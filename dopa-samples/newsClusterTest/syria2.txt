Assad Says He Doesn't Rule out US Attack
CARACAS, Venezuela September 26, 2013 (AP)
Syrian President Bashar Assad said in an interview broadcast Wednesday that he does not discount the possibility of a U.S. military attack even though threatened action was forestalled when he agreed to give up chemical weapons.
Assad also said in an interview broadcast by Venezuela's state-run Telesur network that his government has confessions from rebels that they brought chemical weapons into the civil war-wracked nation.
According to the broadcast's Spanish dubbing, Assad said all evidence pointed to rebel responsibility for the attack.
He said that Syrian authorities had uncovered chemical arms caches and labs and that the evidence had been turned over to Russia, which brokered the deal that helped persuade U.S. President Barack Obama to pull back from threatened military action over an Aug. 21 gas attack that killed civilians in a Damascus suburb.
In a speech at the U.N. on Tuesday, Obama said he would not use military force to depose Assad. But Washington and Moscow remain at odds on how to hold Syria accountable if it does not live up to its pledge to dismantle its chemical weapons stockpile.
Assad predicted during the 40-minute interview that "terrorists" would try to block access of U.N. inspectors who enter Syria to secure the government's chemical arsenal.
While Assad said he had evidence that countries including Saudi Arabia were arming Syrian rebels, he said he had no proof that any particular country had supplied them with chemical weapons.
He was also asked about the apparent thaw in relations between the U.S. and Iran, his government's chief patron in the region.
Assad called the development positive but added that he did not consider it to mean that Tehran's leaders trust Washington. He said it was important that the U.S. stop pressuring Iran not to have nuclear technology.
Assad also accused the Obama administration of lying to U.S. citizens by claiming it has proof that Assad's government was responsible for the Aug. 21 gas attack.
More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria's 2 1/2-year-old civil war.

U.N. Security Council demands elimination of Syria chemical arms

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution on Friday that demands the eradication of Syria's chemical weapons but does not threaten automatic punitive action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government if it does not comply.
The unanimous vote by the 15-member Security Council capped weeks of intense diplomacy between Russia and the United States. It was based on a deal between the two countries reached in Geneva earlier this month following an August 21 sarin nerve gas attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds.
The U.S.-Russia deal averted punitive U.S. military action against Assad's government, which Washington blamed for the August attack. The Syrian government and its ally, Russia, blamed anti-government rebels for the attack.
One provision of the resolution, described by council diplomats as significant, formally endorses a plan for a political transition in Syria agreed on at an international conference in Geneva in June 2012.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said after the vote that the big powers hoped to hold a peace conference on Syria in mid-November in Geneva.
He told the council the plan to eradicate Syria's chemical weapons was "not a license to kill with conventional weapons."
"As we mark this important step, we must never forget that the catalog of horrors in Syria continues with bombs and tanks, grenades and guns," he said. "A red light for one form of weapons does not mean a green light for others."
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the vote showed that "actions have consequences."
"Our original objective was to degrade and deter Syria's chemical weapons capability. And the option of military force that President Obama has kept on the table could have achieved that. But tonight's resolution accomplishes even more - through peaceful means, it will for the first time seek to eliminate entirely a nation's chemical weapons capability," he said.
The resolution does not allow for automatic punitive action in the form of military strikes or sanctions if Syria does not comply. At Russia's insistence, Friday's resolution makes clear a second council decision would be needed for that.
But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Security Council would be prepared to take punitive steps in the event of confirmed violations of the resolution by either side in the conflict.
"The United Nations Security Council ... will stand ready to take action under Chapter 7 of the (U.N.) charter, quite clearly," he said.
A major sticking point to the resolution had been Russia's opposition to writing it under Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, which covers the council's authority to enforce its decisions with measures such as sanctions or military force.
Russia has made clear, however, it would not support the use of force against Assad's government, a major importer of Russian weapons.
Syria's ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar Ja'afari, said Turkey, Saudi Arabia, France, Qatar and the United States must abide by the resolution and be held accountable if they continued assisting the rebels, who Assad's government has accused of using poison gas against the government army.
"You can't bring terrorists from all over the world and send them into Syria in the name of jihad and then pretend that you are working for peace," he said.
Ja'afari said the government was "fully committed to going to Geneva" for the planned peace talks, which the rebels have also suggested they would attend.
U.S. President Barack Obama earlier called the draft U.N. resolution a "potentially huge victory for the international community" and described it as legally binding, verifiable and enforceable.
INSPECTORS HEAD TO SYRIA TUESDAY
A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the resolution deflected attention from Obama's wavering on the Syrian conflict. "For the U.S., this resolution turns the attention away from its powerlessness," he said.
Assad agreed to destroy Syria's chemical weapons following global outrage over a sarin gas attack in the Damascus suburbs last month - the world's deadliest chemical attack in 25 years - and the U.S. military threat.
Lavrov said earlier Russia was working "energetically" to help convene Syria peace talks.
"People continue to die and peaceful civilians suffer every day in Syria," he told the U.N. General Assembly. "Virtually the only possibility today to put an end to this turmoil is to move from a deadlock to the process of political settlement of the Syrian crisis."
As a precursor to the U.N. vote, the 41-member Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons approved a decision in The Hague on Friday laying out procedures to rapidly verify and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. The decision will see inspectors sent to Syria starting on Tuesday.

UNITED NATIONS, Sept 28: The UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution that demands the eradication of Syria’s chemical weapons.
But the resolution adopted late on Friday does not threaten automatic punitive action against the Syrian regime if it does not comply.
The unanimous vote by the 15-member Security Council ended weeks of intense diplomacy between Russia and the United States.
The resolution was based on a deal between the two countries reached in Geneva earlier this month following an Aug 21 sarin nerve gas attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds.
The US-Russia deal averted punitive US military action against president Bashar al-Assad’s government, which Washington blamed for the August attack.
The Syrian government and its ally, Russia, blamed anti-government rebels for the attack.
Late Friday evening US and Russia reached an agreement on the wording of the resolution, which would be legally binding but would not include automatic enforcement, such as sanctions or the use of military force.
Western powers on the Security Council backed away from many of their initial demands, diplomats say, in order to secure Russia’s approval.
The only reference to enforcement in the draft is a threat that if Syria fails to comply with the resolution, the council would impose punitive measures such as sanctions or military action under Chapter 7 of the UN charter, which would require a second resolution that Russia could veto.
One provision of the resolution, described by council diplomats as significant, formally endorses a plan for a political transition in Syria agreed on at an international peace conference in Geneva in June 2012.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised the work of US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in the lead-up to the vote.
“Today’s historic resolution is the first hopeful news on Syria in a long time,” he said.
“For many months I have said that the confirmed use of chemical weapons in Syria would require a firm united response. Tonight the international community has delivered.”
Kerry, for his part, reiterated to the Security Council and Damascus that: “Should the regime fail to act, there will be consequences.”
Syria’s UN ambassador Bashar Ja’afari says the resolution covers most of Damascus’ concerns.
He says countries supporting Syria’s rebels—Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, France and the United States—should also abide by the resolution.

Syria says chemical weapons resolution applies to all parties
U.S., Russia warn of consequences if Syria does not abide to resolution
Kerry says world community imposing binding obligation on Syria
Another body agrees to fast-track Syria entry into Chemical Weapons Convention
United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council, capping a dramatic month of diplomacy, voted unanimously late Friday to require Syria to eliminate its arsenal of chemical weapons -- or face consequences.
"Today's resolution will ensure that the elimination of the Syrian chemical weapons program happens as soon as possible and with the utmost transparency and accountability," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.
The U.N. resolution was based on a deal struck this month between the United States and Russia that averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb that U.S. officials said left at least 1,400 people dead.
The resolution did not authorize the automatic use of force if Syria is said to be in violation, as was previously sought by the United States.
The 15-member Security Council met shortly after the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons , or OPCW, voted to fast-track Syria's addition to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans such weapons.
Bill Clinton on Putin and Syria
U.S., Russia reach deal on Syria
Extremists gain influence among rebels
For nearly two years, the U.N. Security Council had been unable to reach a consensus over what to do to bring about an end to Syria's civil war. Russia and China repeatedly vetoed resolutions dating back to October 2011 that condemned President Bashar al-Assad's government and called for him to step down.
The turnaround came this month, when Russia called for Syria to divest itself of its chemical weapons arsenal after U.S. President Barack Obama accused Syria of crossing a "red line" with the use of nerve gas and threatened a strike.
Syria announced this month that it was willing to join the agreement.
A binding obligation
Both the United States and Russia warned that if Syria failed to adhere to the terms of the U.N. resolution, it would face consequences.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the world community was imposing a binding obligation on the government of al-Assad to get rid of its stockpile.
"This resolution makes clear that those responsible for this heinous act must be held accountable," said Kerry.
If the resolution succeeds, the world "will have eliminated one of the largest chemical weapon arsenals on Earth, eliminating it from one of the most volatile places on Earth," Kerry said.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the council that his country, long an ally of the Syrian government, "will stand ready to take action" if the resolution needs enforcement.
By agreeing to dismantle its chemical weapons program and provide documentation of its arsenal, "Damascus has shown its readiness to cooperate," said Lavrov.
Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Jaafari said the resolution holds all parties in Syria accountable for the use of chemical weapons.
Inspectors return to Syria
U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Syria this week to look into at least a half-dozen claims of chemical weapons use -- some allegedly by the government, others allegedly by rebels.
U.N. inspectors have already confirmed the use of chemical warfare in the rural Damascus suburb of Ateibeh in August, but have not explicitly said who was responsible.
The al-Assad government has repeatedly accused rebels of using chemical weapons, an assertion that has been widely dismissed by most Western leaders.
The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 people have died since March 2011 when a brutal government crackdown against protesters devolved into an all-out civil war.
The Security Council vote followed action by the executive council of the OPCW, meeting in the Netherlands. That group adopted its measure by consensus in about 10 minutes.
"We now have a legal mandate to start a verification mission in Syria," OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan.
The OPCW agreed to an "accelerated program for achieving the complete elimination of Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014," it said in a statement. Inspections in Syria will begin Tuesday.
"The decision also calls for ambitious milestones for destruction, which will be set by the council by 15 November," the organization said.
Obama: 'Very hopeful'
Obama, speaking before the votes, said he was "very hopeful" about the developments, but warned much work remains to be done.
"I think, rightly, people have been concerned about whether Syria will follow through on the commitments that have been laid forth and I think there are legitimate concerns as to how technically we are going to be getting those chemical weapons out while there's still fighting going on the ground," Obama said.
Obama said the threat of U.S. military power pushed Syrian leaders to agree to destroy their chemical weapons and said the resolution "not only deters and prevents additional chemical use but actually goes beyond what could have been accomplished through any military action."
The OPCW plans to send an advance team of inspectors to Damascus, an official with the organization, who declined to be identified while discussing delicate operations, told CNN on Friday.
The official said that in order to meet international deadlines for destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, the group may opt for a "quick and dirty" program that would render the weapons unusable but wouldn't destroy them, the official said.
U.S. official: Syrian CW list more complete than anticipated
'Not a license to kill'
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has said his country is willing to transport and destroy Syrian chemical weapons, although only as part of an international coalition.
Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier in September took to The New York Times to argue against military intervention in Syria.
Striking Syria would have many negative ramifications, Putin argued in the piece, including the killing of innocent people, spreading violence around the Middle East, clouding diplomatic efforts to address Iran's nuclear crisis and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and "unleash(ing) a new wave of terrorism."
In his remarks Friday night, Ban called on both the Syrian government and rebels to stop the fighting.
"As we mark this important step, we must never forget that the catalog of horrors in Syria continues with bombs and tanks, grenades and guns," he said. "A red light for one form of weapons does not mean a green light for others. This is not a license to kill with conventional weapons."
Syria submits 'initial disclosure' of chemical weapons program
'No meaningful enforcement mechanisms'
Two Republican U.S. senators criticized the Security Council vote, saying it will do little to end the civil war.
"This resolution is another triumph of hope over reality," John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a statement. "It contains no meaningful or immediate enforcement mechanisms, let alone a threat of the use of force for the Assad regime's noncompliance."
The pair said al-Assad's forces will continue to "use every weapon in their arsenal short of chemical weapons" on the Syrian people while receiving outside assistance from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah while doing so.
CNN's Phil Gast, Chelsea J. Carter, Dana Ford, Andrew Carey and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.

The Battle Over a Christian Enclave in War-Torn Syria
DUBAI, September 29 (RIA Novosti) – The Syrian leadership’s fears that some chemical weapons could end up in the hands of rebels pushed Damascus to agree to place the weapons under international control, Syria’s foreign minister has told a UAE-based Arabic news channel.
“After militants used chemical weapons a few months ago in Khan al-Assal [near Aleppo], [President Bashar] Assad started thinking about the danger of that problem from the viewpoint of protecting the Syrian people,” Walid Muallem told Sky News Arabia.
Muallem was apparently referring to the March 19 incident in the city of Aleppo that reportedly left 26 civilians and soldiers dead and another 86 people injured. Russia – a key ally of Syria – investigated the alleged chemical weapons use in Aleppo in March and said the type of sarin used in that incident was homemade, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier this week .
Muallem also told Sky News Arabia that some chemical weapons storage sites are hard to reach as rebels control roads leading to them.
“This was one of the reasons why Syria agreed to put its chemical weapons under international control,” he said.
The diplomat expressed regret that the UN had failed to take into account Russia-submitted proof of chemical weapons use by rebels.
Russia remains one of the staunchest supporters of the ruling regime in Syria, where over two years of fighting between government and opposition forces have claimed the lives of more than 100,000 people, according to UN estimates.
The UN Security Council unanimously passed a draft resolution on Friday , imposing binding obligations on the Syrian government to eliminate its chemical weapons program for the first time since unrest began there in March 2011.
The resolution rules out any use of force, Lavrov said Friday, adding that any possible use of force in the future under the UN Charter's Chapter VII would require a new resolution, if there is “conclusive and unequivocal proof” of noncompliance.
Experts from the world's chemical weapons watchdog, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), will depart for Syria soon to inspect the country’s chemical weapon stockpiles, Russia’s foreign minister said Friday in an interview with Russia's Channel One.

Forces Preparing for Possible Strike on Syria
The administration of US President Barack Obama has accused Syrian President Assad’s government of being responsible for an August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus that Washington claims left more than 1,400 dead.
Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly suggested in recent weeks that they have evidence showing that the attack was likely carried out by Syrian rebels seeking to frame Assad in order to secure outside military intervention against government forces.
After weeks of intense diplomacy and an almost three-day marathon of talks in Geneva between Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry, Moscow and Washington reached a breakthrough agreement earlier this month to place Syria’s chemical weapons under international control for eventual destruction.

Lavrov: UNSC Syria Resolution Leaves No Loopholes for Use of Force
Tweet
TEHRAN (FNA)- Russia reached its aim of making sure professionals from the international chemical weapons watchdog are the main actors regarding the UN resolution on Syria, and that there are no loopholes for military action, Russian FM Sergey Lavrov said.
Speaking in an interview with the Russian Channel One, Foreign Minister Lavrov admitted the Russian-American compromise on the UNSC resolution "did not come easy".
But the Russian side has "achieved its goal" in that the resolution on Syria, supporting another document by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), "remains within the framework of the Geneva CommuniquÃ©."
The resolutionâ€™s main principle holds that the leading role in taking under international control and destroying Syriaâ€™s chemical weapons arsenal belongs to OPCW professionals, an aim which will be achieved with the UNâ€™s assistance and protection, Lavrov said.
The document states that both the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition bear responsibility for any violation of the inspectorsâ€™ security, Lavrov stressed.
The minister reiterated that the UNSC resolution rules out any military action against Syria prior to a new resolution, which could be drafted if one of the sides â€“ either the Syrian government, or the opposition â€“ does not comply.
Moreover, Russia made sure there are "no pretexts or loopholes" for the use of force in the resolution on Syria, bearing in mind the Libyan experience and "the capabilities of our partners to interpret the UNSC resolutions," Lavrov said.
As the USNC resolution does not allow any use of force under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the possibility of any state launching a strike against Syria and citing the resolution is "out of question," the minister said.
Lavrov also stressed that the states sponsoring the Syrian opposition bear a particular responsibility for making sure their "fosterlings" would not try and carry out any future provocations.
In contrast to western powers, Russia has repeatedly stated that the Syrian opposition fighters have the capability to deploy chemical weapons, and that there are facts proving that they possess such weapons.
According to Lavrov, Russia has demanded that "any option of further attempts (by the Syrian opposition) to get their hands on chemical weapons and its components, let alone using chemical weapons in the future, is ruled out".
The Russian report, which provides proof "in a professional manner" that the sarin gas used in March 19 attack near Aleppo was crudely handcrafted, has been distributed among the UNSC member states and is now publicly available, Lavrov said. He added that Russia has "intelligence" that the substance used in August 21 attack in Ghouta was the same chemical used in a larger concentration.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi speaks to the UN Security Council on Friday evening after the council's unanimous vote to rid Syria of chemical weapons.[ZHANG YUWEI / CHINA DAILY]
The 15-member United Nations Security Council's unanimous adoption of a resolution to strip Syria's government of its chemical weapons reflects the council's solidarity and points toward a diplomatic solution to the Syria issue, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said after the vote on Friday.
He made the statement at the UN General Assembly's 68th session in New York.
"Neither Syria nor the Middle East region can afford another war," Wang said.
"In dealing with the Syrian issue, the Security Council must bear in mind the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, act with a sense of responsibility to the Syrian people, the world and history, and ensure that any decision it takes can stand the test of history."
Wang noted it was the council's first major joint action on the Syria issue in the past year and said China played a "constructive" role in the "tough" negotiations.
"We are firmly opposed to the use of chemical weapons by any country, any group or any individual," Wang said.
"Whoever uses chemical weapons should be condemned by all."
Wang said the resolution establishes the "overall" objective of the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria and the roadmap for the follow-up work.
"The Chinese side is ready to send experts to participate in relevant work and provide financial support in this regard," Wang said.
He added that the Chinese government has provided more than $11 million in humanitarian assistance to Syrian civilians in and outside of the country.
Experts praised China's role in the council's quest for a peaceful diplomatic solution.
Zhu Zhiqun, political science and international relations professor at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, said China's vote on the resolution reflects its long-standing principles and current policy.
"Viewed from Beijing, this is a much better outcome than a resolution authorizing military strikes against the Syrian government," Zhu said.
Jon Taylor, a political science professor at the University of St. Thomas in Houston, said the resolution is a "laudable first step" in eliminating Syria's chemical weapons and potentially arriving at solutions to end the conflict.
"(It) could not have happened without the direct role that China played in negotiations," Taylor said.
"China and other members of the Security Council have gotten US President Barack Obama out of a diplomatic jam by brokering this agreement."
Russia and China — two of the council's five permanent members — previously vetoed three Western-backed resolutions warning Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime to end the violence on the penalty of possible military intervention. The passed resolution makes the measure legally binding but provides no means of automatic enforcement through sanctions or military force.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the resolution's passage "historic".
"Securing and destroying weapons of mass destruction in a civil war will be daunting," he said.
"We will be working together with the OPCW — the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons — on the modalities to deliver quickly and effectively based on our respective strengths."
The adopted resolution (2118) was a joint effort by the US and Russia who submitted the landmark document on Thursday. Ban and foreign ministers from the council's permanent members held two meetings on the General Assembly's sidelines over the past week to clinch a resolution on Syria.
Wang and US Secretary of State John Kerry met twice in the past two weeks, respectively at the UN headquarters and in Washington DC, for discussions that included Syria.
"With a strong, enforceable, precedent-setting resolution requiring Syria to give up its chemical weapons, the United Nations Security Council has demonstrated that diplomacy can be so powerful, it can peacefully defuse the worst weapons of war," Kerry said.
Paul Heinbecker, a former Canadian ambassador to the UN who now serves as a distinguished fellow with the Center for International Governance and Innovation, said the passage of the resolution is a "major advance" in ridding the world of chemical and other weapons of mass destruction.
But the former diplomat warns that the resolution is "not the end of the Syrian story".
"It is now incumbent on the Security Council — especially the permanent five members, including China — to build on the chemical weapons agreement and bring the civil war to an end," Heinbecker said.
"Assad's military machine remains intact. The military balance has not tipped. The civil war grinds on, the bodies of civilians pile up and the innocent are denied justice."

Why Syria’s Assad won’t Fall
Added by Philip Perry on September 28, 2013.
 
 
New York—The U.N. approved a binding resolution on Friday to strip the Assad regime of its chemical weapons. Damascus’s stockpile will be completely destroyed by the middle of 2014. Assad will also let U.N. experts examine all of its facilities. If Syria fails to comply, another meeting of the Security Council will delineate the consequences whether military intervention or economic sanctions, though Russia will not back a military option. This resolution sounds the death knell for the rebel army. Unless Syria fails to comply, which is unlikely considering how much Russia wants this, Syria’s Assad won’t fall. His consolidation of the country is assured.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced at the same meeting a peace summit to be held in Geneva between Assad and the opposition. But how can peace really be accomplished here? Assad is unlikely to give up territory to the rebel army. And those fighting him would open themselves up to revenge killings from Syrian military forces should they put down their weapons and come back into the fold.
Russia is supplying weapons to the regime, and more advanced one’s that the rebels have such as S300 defensive missile batteries. The U.S. and its allies were too slow in supplying the opposition, and is still skittish about it, lest they fall into the hands of Islamic militants and fuel another blowback scenario a la 9/11. Moscow has sent navy ships to Syria. Russia has troops in Syria, some of which were offered to guard the chemical weapons. Losing Syria would be losing Russia’s sole ally in the Middle East, a black eye at a time when Putin is trying to show the resurgence of Russian power and influence in the world. How can the U.S. strike Syria with Russian military personnel in the way? This situation has all the makings of a serious international incident.
Besides Russia’s shoring up of Syria, the opposition forces are too disorganized. Split between Islamic radicals and secular fighters, the Syrian opposition forces make Western governments, Gulf States and particularly Russia uneasy. This divide also makes it more difficult to create a united front against Assad, and it’s easier for him to draw a wedge between the two. He has also solidified Russian support not only for their fear of losing their only ally in the region, but their dread of Islamic militants having a haven to operate in, and causing further unrest in Chechnya, an Islamic province occupied by Russia.
Another reason why Syria’s Assad won’t fall, the proxy groups the West has supported are impotent. What’s more, the strongest fighters, mostly Islamic militants, recently abandoned the rebels altogether. The Syrian Opposition Coalition (SOC) lost eleven of its most fearsome rebel brigades on Tuesday. The SOC itself is beset by infighting and woefully disorganized. And the momentum the rebels once had is lost. Assad’s forces are better organized, a professionally trained army. In addition, there are reports of Iranian and Hezbollah fighters are fighting alongside the Syrian army.
The war will end soon. The rebels are splintered and without momentum. Moscow has shored up Damascus. Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad has solidified his position, he won’t fall. But in this, a further international incident may have been averted. And the American public, by and large wasn’t behind a strike. But what can we do to assure a peaceful Syria that respects human rights and the rule of law? Right now, it seems the only thing we can safeguard Syrians against is the use of chemical weapons, and only in the long term.

Obama cautiously hails pending UN resolution on Syria
Saturday Sep 28, 2013
Tweet
Washington, Sep 28 — US President Barack Obama Friday said the upcoming UN resolution on Syria's chemical weapons is "potentially a significant step forward".
"This is something that we have long sought," Obama said after a bilateral meeting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the White House.
"We now have a framework... that would be legally binding, that would be verifiable and enforceable, where there will be consequences for Syria's failure to meet what has been set forth in this resolution, I think is a potentially huge victory for the international community," reported Xinhua citing Obama.
A draft resolution legally obligating Syria to give up its chemical stockpiles is expected to be put to a vote at the 15- nation UN Security Council late Friday.
Obama thanked international partners for working in the past days in the UN for reaching the resolution to rid Syria of its stockpiles of chemical weapons. "I've always expressed a preference for resolving this diplomatically," he added.
The US president claimed this was possible because of what he said "a credible threat of US action" against Syria after the alleged Aug 21 chemical attack near Damascus, the capital of Syria.
He noted that the resolution explicitly endorses the agreement by the Geneva international conference on Syria, to deal with the civil war in Syria, and the need for a political transition to bring about peace to this war-torn country.
"So we are very hopeful about the prospects for what can be accomplished, but obviously there is a lot of work to be done," the US president said.
He expressed the concerns whether Syria will honour its commitment to give up its chemical weapons, as well as the technical difficulties in destroying those weapons in this country where fighting is continuing on the ground.
The US government held the Syrian government accountable for the Aug 21 chemical attack which allegedly killed more than 1,400 people, a claim denied by Damascus.

UNITED NATIONS , Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- China has welcomed the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution on Syria , saying it reflected the unity of the council.
The council on Friday voted unanimously to adopt Resolution 2118 aimed at ridding Syria of chemical weapons. The vote came after the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an international chemical weapons watchdog, agreed on a plan to destroy Syria's stockpiles by mid-2014.
"We are heartened to see that the Security Council has just unanimously adopted Resolution 2118, bringing the Syrian situation back to the track of peace from the verge of war and presenting a new opportunity for seeking a political settlement of the Syrian issue," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the council after the vote.
"This is the first time that the Security Council has taken a joint major action on the Syrian issue in more than one year," he said.
"In dealing with the Syrian issue, the Security Council must bear in mind the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, act with a sense of responsibility to the Syrian people, the world and history, and ensure that any decision it takes can stand the test of history," he said.
Wang said China welcomed the fact that the Syrian government joined the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) not long ago.
"Resolution 2118 has set out the overall objective of the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria and the roadmap for the follow-up work," he said.
"We hope that the relevant parties will stay in close cooperation, fulfil their respective responsibilities and implement the OPCW decision and Security Council resolution in a comprehensive and accurate manner so as to eventually achieve a proper settlement of the issue of chemical weapons in Syria," Wang said.
The top Chinese diplomat said neither Syria nor the Middle East region could afford another war, and political settlement was the only way out of the crisis.
He urged a cease-fire and cessation of violence in Syria as soon as possible, as well as efforts to put an end to the crisis through dialogue and to rebuild homes for Syrian people.
China hoped the international community would build consensus and promote the early convening of the Geneva II conference, he said.
As a permanent member of the Security Council, China stood ready to work with all parties and make unremitting efforts for comprehensive, proper and long-term settlement of the Syrian issue, he said.
After the session, Wang also briefed media at the UN headquarters in New York on the Chinese goverment's position on the Syrian conflict.

DAMASCUS, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar Jaafari, said a recent UN Security Council resolution on Syria's chemical weapons addressed the concerns of the Damascus government, the state-run SANA news agency reported Saturday.
Jaafari made the remarks in New York during a press conference after the Security Council voted unanimously to adopt a resolution aimed at ridding war-torn Syria of chemical weapons.
Jaafari called on all countries that fund and arm the rebels in Syria to stop doing so, specifically naming Turkey, Saudi Arabia, France, Qatar, and the United States to commit themselves to the UNSC resolution.
He also said that the Syrian government is "totally committed" to the international conference likely to be held in November in Geneva to craft a political solution to the long-standing crisis in the Arab country.
The UNSC vote came Friday after the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an international chemical watchdog, agreed on a plan to destroy Syria's stockpile by mid- 2014.
"The Security Council decides that the Syrian Arab Republic shall not use, develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons, or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to other States or non-State actors," the resolution said.
The resolution condemned the use of chemical weapons, but also did not attribute blame, stating that the Security Council "is deeply outraged" by the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict and that "the use of chemical weapons anywhere constitutes a threat to international peace and security."
Speaking at the Security Council shortly after the vote, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed the new resolution, saying: " Today's historic resolution is the first hopeful news on Syria in a long time."
Earlier this month, a UN fact-finding group confirmed the use of chemical weapons in an attack outside the Syrian capital of Damascus on Aug. 21, but did not point out who was responsible.

The U.N.'s resolution on Syria: The good and the bad
On the one hand, it's a breakthrough that Russia and U.S. agreed on anything. On the other hand, where are the teeth?
By Peter Weber  | September 27, 2013

T
hursday was a busy day at the United Nations headquarters in New York City. Secretary of State John Kerry held the highest-level U.S.-Iran meeting since the 1979 Iran-hostage crisis, and by evening, the five veto-wielding powers on the United Nations Security Council agreed on a resolution compelling Syria to hand over its stockpile of chemical weapons.
The resolution is not a done deal, exactly. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), based in The Hague, has to approve its own plan for inspecting and destroying Syria's chemical weapons before the U.N. Security Council votes on its resolution. But it's expected that the full Security Council will approve the Syria resolution as early as Friday.
It's kind of remarkable that the U.N. Security Council has agreed to anything on Syria, after years of stalemate, and the resolution is a pretty big readjustment for an Obama administration ready to lob missiles into Syria less than three weeks ago. But is it a good deal? Here's a look at what's in the U.N. resolution, and whom it benefits:
1. Syria is legally bound to give up its chemical stockpiles
It's a minor miracle we are here at all. Starting with Kerry's off-the-cuff suggestion that Syria could avoid U.S. airstrikes by handing over all its chemical weapons, through dicey U.S.-Russian nuts-and-bolts negotiations in Geneva, the deal could have fallen apart at any time. It's not like this was the first time a solution was presented to the U.N. Security Council.
"Three times the United States has brought resolutions to the U.N. to condemn the Syrian regime over the brutality of the country's civil war," says Agence France-Presse . "And three times its efforts were felled by Moscow."
Now, Russia has signed onto an agreement that legally compels Syria to "not use, develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons, or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to other states or nonstate actors."
2. There's no surefire enforcement mechanism
"This resolution makes clear there will be consequences for noncompliance," American U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power said Thursday night . U.S. and British diplomats called the resolution "binding and enforceable." But there's some disagreement over how enforceable the resolution really is.
In a win for the U.S., any noncompliance from Syria will be remanded to the Security Council, which can "impose measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter." Chapter VII is the big gun in the U.N. arsenal, and can include authorizing military force and sanctions. In a win for Russia, any Chapter VII sanction will require another Security Council resolution, meaning another vote — which Russia can veto.
"Skeptics worry that the process may become drawn out as it was during the 1990s when the United Nations sought to inspect Saddam Hussein's arsenal in Iraq," says Michael R. Gordon at The New York Times . And Russia could drag its feet, buying precious time for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. "Proponents of the measure say Russia may be cooperative because it shares the West's concern about maintaining zero tolerance for chemical weapons use," especially so close to its own borders.
3. The resolution sets a new precedent against chemical weapons use
One clause in the resolution that Western diplomats are touting "determines that the use of chemical weapons anywhere constitutes a threat to international peace and security." That provides a legal basis for enforcing the Syria agreement, but also sets a precedent for Security Council intervention whenever chemical weapons are used anywhere in the world.
That is the part that Power highlighted on Twitter:
The draft UNSCR establishes that #Syria 's use of CW is threat to international peace & security & creates a new norm against the use of CW.
— Samantha Power (@AmbassadorPower) September 26, 2013
4. It doesn't end the Syria civil war
The framework agreed to by Russia and the U.S. envisions the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by the middle of 2014 — a goal made more plausible by the fact, according to The Washington Post , that most of Assad's stockpile "consists of 'unweaponized' liquid precursors that could be neutralized relatively quickly."
But the Security Council accord does nothing to stop non-chemical attacks in Syria, and, in fact, it probably aids Assad to the detriment of the U.S.-backed rebels.
"I think Assad feels that the chemical weapons actually saved his regime, rather than brought it down," one well-placed source in Damascus tells Reuters Samia Nakhoul . With the threat of international military intervention over, Assad can now, Nakhoul says, consolidate his hold on Damascus, Homs, and the Mediterranean coast, leaving the Islamist and U.S.-aligned militias to fight over the rest of the country.
All things considered, the Security Council resolution is probably a good thing for minimizing the world's supplies chemical weapons, a partial win for Russia and Assad, a mixed bag for the U.S. and its European allies, and a net loss for the forces battling Assad. A lot depends on how the resolution is carried out, and how committed Russia is to eliminating Syria's chemical weapons.
"Along with an historic high level meeting with Iran — a supporter of the Assad government — and some progress in Middle East talks, the Syria resolution represents diplomatic progress for the Obama administration, although time will tell if these initiatives work," says Pamela Falk at CBS News . "The next difficult step will be getting the parties in Syria to sit down to negotiate in Geneva."

Deal reached on UN resolution on Syrian chemical weapons
UNITED NATIONS: International chemical weapon troubleshooters will enter war-torn Syria on Tuesday to start one of the biggest and most dangerous disarmament operations ever staged.
With more than 1,000 tonnes of sarin, mustard gas and other banned horror chemicals stocked across the country, the United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog have launched an urgent appeal for scarce experts to join the mission.
Applicants must be ready to face mortal risks and an impossible deadline.
UN leader Ban Ki-moon called the operation "daunting" after the UN security council voted on Friday to eliminate President Bashar al-Assad's chemical arms.
The mission by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which polices the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, will run in parallel to a UN investigation into a huge sarin gas attack in Damascus in August and other suspected attacks.
Final details of a US-Russia plan to dispose of stockpiles at an estimated 45 sites have still not been agreed, UN diplomats said.
Clean-ups of chemical nasties have been staged in Iraq and Libya , but never in the middle of a raging war.
The UN says the Syrian conflict has already left more than 100,000 dead.
Experts say the OPCW will need up to 200 inspectors for the Syria force. It currently has less than half that number who already have a heavy regular workload. The watchdog has had to appeal to the major powers to send scientists.
Those who go will become a new target in the 30-month-old conflict and the strife means the noxious potions will have to be moved out of Syria to be destroyed.
The US-Russia plan sets a target date of mid-2014 for completion, but few people believe it is achievable.
"No operation this big has been carried out before and certainly not in a war," said Dina Esfandiary, a disarmament specialist with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
The Syrian government has declared one list of chemical sites and weapons. It has until Friday to send more information to the OPCW. "The first obstacle is it is very difficult for us to know for certain whether Assad has declared all his stockpiles," Esfandiary told AFP.
"The inspectors will then become perfect targets in a situation of civil war. Anyone who wants to derail the process â€” and I am sure a lot of people will want to do that â€” will be able to target them as they visit the various sites."
UN investigators have already been the target of snipers in Damascus.
Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a consultant and former commanding officer of Britain's chemical and nuclear defence force, said that destroying the chemicals in Syria is not an option in the middle of a war.
Finished chemical bombs are normally destroyed in furnaces that would be impossible to build in Syria.
In Iraq, experts sometimes just dug holes in the desert and put in fuel and a detonator to incinerate the chemicals. Syria's dangers mean that even those measures are not possible.
"The ideal plan would be for the Syrians to deliver chemical weapons to the border, where the UN and the major powers take over to get rid of them," Bretton-Gordon told AFP.
He estimated that it would take about 200 experts working flat out for six months to get all the chemicals into international hands.
"It is going to take a lot longer to destroy them," said the expert, whose company is training doctors and nurses in Syria on dealing with chemical warfare. "It could take a couple of years."
The United States and Russia have embarked on voluntary programs to destroy their chemical arsenals. But they have both have asked the OPCW for a deadline extension because the task is so complicated.
Both countries have the furnaces to dispose of the chemicals, but Russia has indicated it is reluctant to accept Syrian arms.
The cost will also be huge. Assad has said it will take one year and one billion dollars to get rid of his weapons.
Experts warn this will be just the cost of getting the chemicals out of Syria. "In resource terms, it is going to be huge," said Bretton-Gordon.
A UN diplomat likened the operation to a "minefield." "You defuse one bomb and there is another waiting," the diplomat added. Esfandiary noted it was likely the scientists would fail to meet the deadline.
"But even if they are able to degrade a portion of Syria's weapons, then it is worth pursuing," she said.

It goes without saying that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is a monster. He’s killed thousands of his own citizens, unleashed chemical weapons against rebels, and is closely associated with Iran’s dangerous rulers.
But it also needs to be said, as President John Quincy Adams did, that the United States “goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy.”
Adams was speaking in 1821, explaining the foreign policy of the Founders. His father played a vital role in the creation of the country, and J.Q. Adams helped it grow and thrive decades later. He was serving as Secretary of State when he discussed American foreign policy, and he went on to serve a term as president.
This all matters as we consider how to handle Syria, and its resident monsters, today.
As analyst
Marion Smith writes in a Heritage Foundation Special Report, the Founders provide a handy guide about how the country should handle foreign problems today.
“America’s Founders actually advocated and acted upon the idea that prosperity at home comes through active trade abroad and that peace is best secured through military strength and foreign respect of U.S. sovereignty and the principles of liberty,” he writes. They were neither isolationist nor interventionist. They were pragmatic.
He adds that the Founders were wary of permanent political alliances, foreign intrigue at home, and coercive foreign powers. They aimed to protect America’s strategic independence and support U.S. interests. “Early diplomatic efforts were therefore dedicated to maintaining America’s strategic independence at all costs and were aimed at concluding treaties that strengthened U.S. sovereignty.”
Using that standard, the U.S. should only use military force if it serves a vital national interest. That’s a far cry from a Progressive foreign policy, of course. That concept, born a century or so ago, teaches that the U.S. should act only when our interests are not at stake, since promoting our self-interest would be inherently bad. It’s an idea the Founders would have dismissed out of hand.
Despite his progressive tendencies, President Obama seems to be saying he agrees with the Founders. Discussing the use of chemical weapons in Syria, he said : “This attack is an assault on human dignity. It also presents a serious danger to our national security.” But while the first part of that statement is clearly true, the second part is far from proven.
It is indeed dangerous for Syria to have chemical weapons. But it would be far worse for those weapons to end up in the hands of al Qaeda or Hezbollah terrorists. And while the administration has offered some half-hearted reasons for intervening, it hasn’t explained how U.S. vital interests are at risk, nor has it shown that the American people would be gravely threatened if our military doesn’t intervene.
That doesn’t mean we should do nothing at all. In a recent paper, regional expert Jim Phillips laid out some steps our government should take to contain Syrian aggression. He writes that the U.S. should:
· Work with friends and allies to prevent terrorists from obtaining Assad’s chemical weapons.
· Cultivate allies within the Syrian opposition, especially non-Islamist forces that would be willing to monitor the disposition of Assad’s chemical weapons, track their movements, and destroy or seize them if necessary.
· Work with regional allies to strengthen non-Islamist opposition forces and accelerate the fall of the Assad regime.
Whenever anything bad happens, seemingly anywhere in the world, all eyes seem to turn to the United States. We’re the world’s leading nation, but we cannot be the world’s policeman.
It’s clearly in our best interest to help shape a stable Syria, one that doesn’t threaten its own people or its neighbors and one that surrenders its chemical weapons and other WMD. Those outcomes will require American involvement, but don’t require American military intervention.
It’s a crucial difference, one the Founders would have appreciated.

Russia to help Syria guard chemical weapons sites
Prime Minister John Key has praised a resolution by the United Nations Security Council to destroy Syria's civil weapons.
The UN Security Council adopted the resolution that demands the eradication of Syria's chemical weapons but does not threaten automatic punitive action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government if it does not comply.
The unanimous vote by the 15-member Security Council ended weeks of intense diplomacy between Russia and the United States.
It was based on a deal between the two countries reached in Geneva earlier this month following an August 21 sarin nerve gas attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds.
The resolution came just a day after Mr Key used his UN General Assembly address to criticise the Security Council's inaction..
"While it doesn't do everything we asked for, it goes a long way toward that. So i think that's been a positive step," Mr Key said.
"I doesn't specifically spell out how it would hold the regime to account, but it does do the most important job for how chemical weapons would be collected up in Syria," he said.
As his last engagement in New York, Mr Key met with the UN Secretary General offering Ban Ki Moon $2.6 million in aid and assistance for Syria and the chemical weapons destruction.
New Zealand will provide $604,000 to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and $2 million to humanitarian relief efforts in Syria and neighbouring countries.
"Together with the United Nations, the OPCW will lead the effort to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons stocks under the Geneva Framework agreed by the United States and Russia," Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully said.

He said New Zealand welcomed the framework agreement as a strong and constructive response to the horrific use of chemical weapons against civilians in Syria.
New Zealand's contribution to the OPCW Trust Fund for Syria will now assist in implementing the agreement, Mr McCully said.
The humanitarian funding will go toward the International Committee of the Red Cross to help those affected by the conflict within Syria, the World Food Programme to assist Syrian refugees in Jordan, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency aiding Palestinian refugees also affected by the conflict.

UN resolution on Syria may allow for actions against supporters of rebels - Rick Rozoff
© Photo "The Voice of Russia"
Download audio file
The full text of the United Nations Resolution on Syria has been published and thanks to the efforts of the Russian Federation and China is one of the most balanced of such documents in the last century. However there remains the threat of a western attack on Syria. In an interview with the Voice of Russia World Service, regular contributor Rick Rozoff also stated that there exists language in the resolution that could even allow for measures to be taken against an party that provides or supports the Syrian “opposition” with chemical and or other non-conventional weapons.
Hello this is John Robles I am speaking with Rick Rozoff the owner of Stop NATO and the Stop NATO international mailing list.
Robles: Can you tell us about the United Nations Resolution on Syria? Are there any holes or loops in it that the United States might use to go ahead with a bombing campaign on that country?
Rozoff: I fear there is indeed and actually there are two that I can think of immediately. The resolution itself was adopted unanimously by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: Russia, China, France, Britain, the United States, and the current ten rotating member states.
It makes some effort to be balanced. It is better than what, I’m sure, The US, Britain and France would have wanted, and that’s because of Russia in the first place. The Russian and Chinese influence, I think, trying to introduce the balanced and moderate resolution. However, it mandates a number of issues, including the monitoring of chemical and other non-conventional weapons inside Syria.
Presumably, by all sides, though, when it comes to compliance issues and ultimately the use of Chapter 7, as they are called, measures against the perpetrators of the violations of chemical weapons regulations but only the state could be held accountable. I hardly see how the rag tag and irregular military forces supported by the West could be held accountable. They could be sanctioned, for example, but I don’t know if they could be bombed.
But what’s most alarming is that the penultimate demand in the resolution, Number 21, and I’m reading it verbatim, decides in the event of non-compliance with this resolution including unauthorized transfer of chemical weapons or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in the Syrian Arab Republic, to impose measures under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter and what’s important to realize in that, there are several articles under Chapter 7, but the operative one and the one that we are most concerned about right now is Article 42 which reads as follows: Should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in the earlier Article 41 would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, they may take such actions by air, sea and land forces as it may be necessary to maintain and restore international peace and security and these include, I’m quoting again, demonstrations, blockade and other operations by air, sea or land forces of members of the United Nations, in other words war.
And what we are talking about, of course, most recently is some equivalent of UN Resolution 1973 in March of 2011 that led to contrary to what the Resolution asserts: a full six-month war by the Pentagon and NATO against the nation of Libya.
The resolution passed recently does not stipulate Chapter 7 measures, I mean that’s the Russian contribution to have that left out but at the end it leaves a little bit of room for the West – the United States, Britain, France and their allies – to come back to the Security Council and demand implementation of Chapter 7 Military Intervention against the government of Syria.
Robles: Right. But that would still require the approval of all the members of the UN Security Council, wouldn’t it?
Rozoff: Actually, it wouldn’t have to be all members. One permanent member alone could veto it, Russia or China.
In theory it would be unanimous but not necessarily. Russia and China could abstain, vote against and then not veto it and this is what happened with Libya indeed. So either assent or passive assent is guaranteed by voting for or abstaining. Or even voting against and not vetoing.
We’ll see but even though I think that we can pause for a little while and hope that in contravention of the UN Security Council and the recently passed Resolution 2118, the US will not once again act outside of and in direct contradiction to the United Nations, as it did 14 years ago against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and as it did 10 years ago against Iraq and as it has in any number of other cases since the creation of the United Nations.
So I think, a couple of things: there is still the real threat of a US and allied military action against Syria regardless of this resolution bit I think that we can agree that the adept Russian diplomatic initiative has put a spoke in the wheel of the western war machine.

Kerry: UN Vote Proves Security Council Capable of 'Doing Big Things'
3:50AM Sunday
September 29, 2013
(WASHINGTON) -- Secretary Kerry praised the United Nations Security Council for it's unanimous vote approving a resolution that will require Syria to destroy it's chemical weapons stockpile.
"Just two weeks ago this outcome would have been utterly unimaginable," said Kerry.
"When we put aside politics for the common good we are still capable of doing big things."
He thanked his Russian and European counterparts for their diplomacy over the last month to get this resolution passed.
"Tonight with a strong and forceable precedent setting resolution requiring Syria to give up it's criminal weapons the UN Security Council has demonstrated that diplomacy can be so powerful it can peacefully diffuse the worst weapons of war," said Kerry.
The measure holds Syria accountable for living up to it's pledge to give up it's chemical weapons with a legally binding resolution. Kerry inferred that the diplomacy happened because of President Obama's threat of force but, the end result so far is a positive one.
"Our original objective was to degrade and deter syria's chemical weapons capability. And the option of military force president obama has kept on the table could have achieved that," said Kerry. "But tonight's resolution in fact accomplishes even more. Through peaceful means it will for the first time seek to eliminate an entire nation's chemical weapons capability and, in this case, specifically Syria's.
Kerry laid out some specifics in the resolution, with which Syria will be required to comply.
On site inspections are to begin in November and the chemical weapons are to be destroyed by this time next year.
Syria cannot reject or select any inspectors and must give inspectors unfettered  access to all sites.
If Syria does not comply the council can impose measures under Chapter 7 of the UN charter, which could include authorizing the use of force.
UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon also praised the "historic" vote, saying that the international community has delivered on its responsibilities.
He announced that all parties, along with Syria special envoy Brahimi, have agreed to the next Geneva political conference with the Syrian government and opposition taking place in mid-november.
But for all the praise, ki-Moon reminded the Security Council that tens of thousands of Syrians have been killed, and continue to be killed by conventional weapons, a problem that the international community will need to address.
"As we mark this important step, we must never forget that the catalogue of horrors in Syria continues with bombs and tanks, grenades and guns," said the Secretary General, adding that the resolution cannot be seen as a "license to kill" with conventional weapons.  
"A red light for one form of weapons does not mean a green light for others," he said.

Map: Syrian Arab Republic
The international chemical weapons watchdog tasked with destroying Syria's stockpile says its first wave of experts will travel to Damascus later today.
It follows yesterday's successful vote in the United Nations Security Council to adopt a binding resolution on ridding Syria of chemical weapons.
Michael Luhan of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) says that with international support, the plan should be carried out by the middle of next year.
"Our considered assessment is that with full international support for this mission and with the full cooperation of the Syrian government authorities that this mission is doable and it's doable within the time-frame that's been laid down by the Geneva framework agreement," Mr Luhan said.
Assad's future not up for discussion: Syria FM
Syria is "comfortable" with the UN Security Council resolution on destroying its chemical weapons and will not discuss the future of president Bashar al-Assad, the country's foreign minister said on Saturday.
Walid Muallem told reporters the resolution voted by the 15-nation council late on Friday meant the opposition could be the target of UN sanctions.
"I am comfortable with the resolution," Mr Muallem said at the UN headquarters where he will give Syria's address to the UN General Assembly on Monday.
"It calls for Chapter VII against the terrorists," the foreign minister added.
Mr Assad's government habitually calls the opposition groups battling to overthrow him "terrorists".
Although the UN resolution allows the OPCW to start a mission this week to collect and destroy Syria's arms, it does not allow for immediate sanctions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter in Syria.
However, there could be a new vote on measures if the disarmament accord is violated.
The UN says chemical weapons were used in an August 21 attack in Damascus that left hundreds dead.
The United States and other western nations blame government forces for the killings. Mr Assad's government says opposition rebels were behind the sarin gas attack.
Mr Muallem said he was "worried" that opposition groups have chemical weapons.
The UN is also hoping to organise a Syria peace conference in mid-November to negotiate a transitional government. But Mr Muallem signaled that there could be no talk of Mr Assad's departure, as the opposition and Western nations have demanded.
"There can be no discussion of the future of president Assad. It is in the constitution," Mr Muallem said.
US president Barack Obama told the UN General Assembly again this week that Mr Assad would have to quit.
Mr Muallem said Mr Assad was determined to see out his term and would stand for re-election.
Mr Assad has said there will be an election in 2014.

Syrian rebels capture border post near Jordan
Control of Ramtha crossing changes hands after days of fighting that has left 26 soldiers and several rebels dead.
Last Modified: 28 Sep 2013 17:32
The Ramtha border crossing between Syria and Jordan has been closed for nearly two years now [AP]
Syrian rebels, including members of an al-Qaeda-linked group, have captured a military post on the border with Jordan after four days of fighting, according to an activist group.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 26 government soldiers were killed in Saturday's battle as well as a number of rebels, including seven foreign fighters.
The Ramtha post served in the past as the customs office on the border with Jordan.
It was turned into an army post years ago.
The post is on the outskirts of the southern city of Deraa where the uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime began in March 2011.
The uprising later turned into a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people, according to the UN.
Symbolic victory
Al Jazeera's Nisreen El-Shamayleh, reporting from Jordan, said the importance of the rebels' victory remains merely symbolic.
"The border crossing has been closed for nearly two years now. It was closed while it was under the control of the Syrian army," she said.
"So it definitely won't be opened by Jordan now, especially that the rebels who captured it are not part of the Saudi-backed military council in Deraa, whom Jordan had some security coordination with."
Officials in Jordan refused to comment on the takeover, saying they would not issue statements on events that are taking place on the side of a sovereign state outside their territory.
The Naseeb-Jaber border crossing is the only operational post between Syria and Jordan. The Syrian side of it is under the control of the Syrian army.
There is close coordination between the governments in Amman and Damascus on security maintenance at the crossing.
Rebels control multiple areas along the borders with Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Lebanon as well as the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
The clashes in Syria comes a day after the UN Security Council voted unanimously to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile.
The vote late was the first resolution passed on the Syrian conflict since it began 30 months ago, after Russia and China had previously vetoed three Western-backed resolutions pressuring President Bashar Assad's regime to end the violence.
Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, told the council immediately after the vote that he aimed to hold long-sought talks aimed at organising a political transition in Syria in mid-November.
"All violence must end. All the guns must fall silent," Ban said as he hailed the "historic resolution" on Assad's chemical weapons stockpile, stressing it was not "a licence to kill" with conventional arms.
Shortly before the vote, the UN said its team of weapons experts currently in Syria would investigate seven sites of alleged chemical attacks in the country, four more than previously known.
The team initially visited Syria last month to investigate three alleged chemical attacks this year. But just days into the visit, the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Ghouta was hit by a chemical strike, and the inspectors turned their attention to that case.
Sarin use confirmed
The UN inquiry determined that the nerve agent sarin was used in the August 21 attack, but it did not assess who was behind it.
The investigators currently in Syria expect to finalise its activities in the country by Monday, a UN statement said.
The world's chemical weapons watchdog adopted on Thursday a US-Russian plan that lays out benchmarks and timelines for cataloguing, quarantining and ultimately destroying Syria's chemical weapons, their precursors and delivery systems.
The Security Council resolution enshrines the plan approved by Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), making it legally binding.
The agreement allows the start of a mission to rid Syria's regime of its estimated 1,000-tonne chemical arsenal by mid-2014, significantly accelerating a destruction timetable that often takes years to complete.
The OPCW decision calls for a team of experts responsible for tracking down Syria’s stockpile to be in Damascus by Tuesday.

Does the UN resolution mark a turning point in the Syrian conflict?
Inside Syria Last Modified: 29 Sep 2013 10:30
After weeks of negotiations, intense diplomacy and the threat of military action, the United Nations has finally agreed on a resolution to destroy Syria's chemical weapons.
Obama is focusing only on chemical weapons. He is quite specific that he is not intending to change the balance of power on the ground or to solve the Syrian civil war.... Assad is not going to go anywhere ... he is a power on the ground, he is not going to step down.
Joshua Landis, the director of the Center for Middle East studies
On Friday, the 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on the deal put forward by the US and Russia.
The vote came after the international chemical watchdog agreed on a plan to destroy Syria's stockpile by mid-next year.
"Together the world with a single voice for the first time is imposing binding obligations on the Assad regime, requiring it to get rid of  weapons that have been used to devastating effect as tools of terror," said John Kerry, the US secretary of state.
But Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, made clear what the agreement is not: "This resolution does not fall under chapter seven of the UN Charta and does not allow for any automatic use of coercive measures of enforcement."
The passing of this resolution breaks a two-and-half year deadlock at the UN over Syria, where at least 100,000 people have been killed since the conflict began.
So will this agreement now pave the way for talks on the broader Syrian issue? Is it a turning point in the Syrian conflict? What are the prospects for peace? Could it be the first step towards a broader ceasefire?
Inside Syria, with presenter Folly Bah Thibault, discusses with guests: Najib Ghadbian, the representative of the Syrian National Coalition at the UN; Joshua Landis, the director of the Center for Middle East studies and a professor at the University of Oklahoma; and Ammar Waqqaf, a Syrian political activist.
"This resolution focuses on the issue of disarming the Syrian regime of its chemical weapons arsenal. But it doesn't really address two issues: Those who used chemical weapons against their population ... are still unaccountable. And it doesn't really address the fact that more than 100,000 Syrians were killed by conventional weapons .... This regime has not limit, they are willing to go to the extreme ... so to take that weapon from them is a positive development."
Najib Ghadbian, the representative of the Syrian National Coalition at the UN

Obama: Syria must 'follow through' on commitments
27 September 2013 Last updated at 21:09 BST
US President, Barack Obama, told journalists that rhetoric on possible military action in Syria was key to the "significant step forward" the country had committed to take after the UN confirmed chemical weapons were used outside Damascus in August.
Speaking in the Oval office, Mr Obama said "there is a lot of work to be done, rightly people have been concerned about whether Syria would follow through on the commitments that have been laid forth."
He also expressed concern about the logistics involved in Syria handing over it's chemical weapons to the international community.

UN inspectors are investigating seven alleged chemical weapons attacks in Syria - three of which happened after the 21 August Damascus incident that led to threats of US military action.
Little is known about the latest three alleged attacks, which the Syrian government asked the UN to investigate.
The 21 August attack left hundreds dead; the resulting outcry led Syria to offer up its chemical weapons arsenal.
The UN will vote later on a plan of action to eliminate the stockpile.
Its resolution is expected to incorporate the text of an agreement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), whose 41-nation executive council is currently meeting in The Hague to give formal approval to the plan.
The OPCW will be responsible for dealing with Syria's chemical weapons, and has said it will send in its own team of inspectors next Tuesday.
US President Barack Obama said agreement on the issue by UN Security Council members was a "potentially huge victory for the international community".
Analysis
Jonathan Marcus BBC diplomatic correspondent
The UN team investigating the seven alleged chemical attacks is entirely separate from the more comprehensive effort to rid Syria of chemical weapons agreed at the UN Security Council in New York.
This is a renewal of work by the team that was already in Syria last month that was diverted for the urgent investigation of the attacks in the Damascus suburbs on 21 August.
It has returned to investigate alleged attacks at seven separate incidents. Strikingly three of them are alleged to have taken place after the 21 August. These incidents, according to the UN "warrant further investigation".
The investigation of these three allegations comes at the request of Syria's ambassador to the UN who claims these were the work of rebel forces.
Russia has frequently charged that elements of the Syrian opposition have used chemical weapons - though so far no evidence has been found.
The UN itself investigated the 21 August attacks and its evidence points strongly to the use of Sarin-filled rockets by the Syrian regime.
Meanwhile violence goes on in Syria. Activists said a car bomb killed at least 20 people near a mosque in Rankus, a town north of Damascus, just after Friday prayers.
Militants accused
In a statement, the UN said its current inspection team in Syria is investigating seven allegations of chemical weapons use this year.
The team, led by Ake Sellstrom, arrived in Syria for its second visit on 25 September and hopes to finish its work by Monday 30 September, the statement said.
It is working on a "comprehensive report" into the allegations that it hopes to have finished by late October.
The UN listed the alleged attacks, which all took place this year, as Khan al-Assal on 19 March; Sheikh Maqsoud on 13 April; Saraqeb on 29 April; Ghouta on 21 August; Bahhariya on 22 August; Jobar on 24 August and Ashrafieh Sahnaya on 25 August.
Syria has pushed for the investigation of the three post-21 August incidents.
Its envoy to the United Nations, Bashar Jaafari, accused "militants" of using chemical gas against the army in Bahhariya, Jobar and Ashrafieh Sahnaya.
It was the Ghouta incident of 21 August that sparked international outrage and the threat of military action from the US and its allies.
Since then, Russia - an ally of Syria - has secured an agreement from Damascus to give up its chemical weapons.
Earlier this month, the US and Russia asked the world's chemical weapons watchdog, the OPCW, to decide how to ensure the "complete elimination of all chemical weapons material and equipment" in Syria by the first half of 2014.

The UN Security Council has unanimously adopted a binding resolution on ridding Syria of chemical weapons.
At a session in New York, the 15-member body backed the draft document agreed earlier by Russia and the US.
The deal breaks a two-and-a-half year deadlock in the UN over Syria, where fighting between government forces and rebels rages on.
The vote came after the international chemical watchdog agreed on a plan to destroy Syria's stockpile by mid-2014.

Analysis Nick Bryant BBC News, New York
Only a few weeks ago, this landmark vote would have seemed highly improbable, if not unimaginable: a Security Council deadlocked for two-and-half years on Syria agreeing, with every hand raised, to a binding resolution.
After the 21 August attack in the suburbs of Damascus, its members could not even agree on a press statement condemning the killings.
The resolution has two key demands: that Syria abandon its chemical weapons stockpile and for weapons experts to be given unfettered access to make sure it is dismantled by the middle of next year.
But the resolution doesn't authorise the automatic use of force if Syria is held in violation, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov determinedly pointed out.
Punitive measures, like military action or sanctions, would require a second resolution, and then Moscow would likely wield its veto.
Nor does the resolution attribute guilt for the 21 August attack, the massacre that ended up transforming the diplomatic dynamic. Despite the agreement reached in Geneva two weeks ago which this resolution enshrines, Russia and America remain at odds over who was to blame.
For the first time, though, the Security Council has endorsed a roadmap for a political transition in Syria and the UN has also set a target date for a new peace conference in mid-November.

He urged the Syrian government to implement the resolution "faithfully and without delay", and also announced a tentative date of mid-November for a new peace conference in Geneva.
US Secretary of State John Kerry said the UN demonstrated that "diplomacy can be so powerful that it can peacefully defuse the worst weapons of war".
He said the resolution would for the first time seek to eliminate entirely a nation's chemical weapons capability.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also hailed the move, saying Moscow was ready to take part in "all operations" in Syria.
However, he stressed that the success of international efforts was "not only on Damascus' shoulders" and that Syrian opposition must co-operate.
The UN resolution condemns the use of chemical weapons but does not attribute blame.
The text has two legally binding demands: that Syria abandon its weapons stockpile and that the chemical weapons experts be given unfettered access.
Although the draft refers to Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which allows the use of military force, a second resolution authorising such a move would be needed.
US President Barack Obama earlier said agreement on the issue by council members would be a "potentially huge victory for the international community".
Previous attempts at a resolution stumbled amid disagreements between Russia and the US on how to deal with the crisis in Syria.
The US - backed by France and the UK - had pushed for a resolution carrying the threat of military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces. Russia had opposed this.
Reacting to the vote, Syria's UN Ambassador Bashar Jaafari said the resolution covered most of Damascus' concerns.
But he stressed that countries supporting Syrian rebels should also abide by the adopted document.
'Unmistakable message'
The UN vote came just hours after the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) adopted what it called "a historic decision on the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons".
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.
UK Foreign Secretary William Hague: "It is a ground-breaking resolution"
In a statement after a late-night meeting in The Hague, the watchdog said its executive council "agreed on an accelerated programme for achieving the complete elimination of Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014. The decision requires inspections in Syria to commence from 1 October 2013".
"The decision also calls for ambitious milestones for destruction which will be set by the (executive) council by 15 November."
OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu said the move "sends an unmistakable message that the international community is coming together to work for peace in Syria".
These are uncharted waters for the OPCW, a small organisation that has never undertaken a job of this size or complexity, says the BBC's world affairs correspondent Paul Adams.
It will need a lot of help and is expected to ask for urgent funding and additional personnel, he adds.

UN Security Council Nears Vote on Syria Chemical Measure
By Sangwon Yoon & Kambiz Foroohar - 2013-09-27T17:47:26Z
After weeks of negotiations between the U.S. and Russia , the United Nations Security Council set a vote tonight on a resolution requiring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to surrender all his chemical weapons.
An agreement yesterday on terms for the resolution unites international pressure against Assad, said a U.S. State Department official who described the accord as historic and unprecedented. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic talks.
The Security Council has scheduled a meeting on the agreement today at 8 p.m. New York time.
The resolution leaves unanswered questions about how, when or to whom the Syrian leader must deliver an estimated 1,000 tons of nerve gas and other chemical weapons and their precursors. It also doesn’t specify how the UN and its Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons could determine whether Assad has complied or how the Security Council might compel Syria to honor the agreement.
“There are legitimate concerns as to how, technically, we’re going to be getting those chemical weapons out while there’s still fighting going on,” U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters today at the White House. “Nevertheless, this represents potentially a significant step forward.”
Russian UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters in New York last night that the U.S. and Russia had submitted a draft plan to disarm Syria of chemical weapons to the executive council of the chemical weapons body in the Netherlands. That group, based in The Hague , is expected to vote today on a detailed road map to locate, secure, remove and eventually destroy Syria’s toxic arsenal.
Punitive Measures
Agreement on the UN’s Syria resolution had been complicated by disagreements between the U.S. and Russia over a number of issues, including the threat of military force or other punitive measures against Assad’s government if it fails to give up its chemical weapons.
While the document authorizes the Security Council to implement punitive measures, it doesn’t threaten the automatic use of force against Assad’s regime, as the U.S. and its European allies had wanted. Instead, it calls for the UN “to impose measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.”
Russia, an Assad ally, has used its veto to block previous Security Council attempts to censure the Syrian regime for actions during a 2 1/2-year civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions more, according to UN estimates.
Rebel Groups
The Russians, who with Assad have argued that rebel groups also have used chemical weapons, balked at language the U.S., France and the U.K. wanted holding Assad’s regime responsible for the gas attacks. Instead, the UN resolution calls for punitive action “for any use of chemical weapons by anyone in the Syrian Arab Republic.”
The resolution also doesn’t specify what timetable Assad must meet to free Syria of its chemical arms by the middle of next year, a deadline set in a framework agreement reached this month in Geneva between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry .
Assad’s regime has portrayed the Geneva accord as a victory in a battle to foil U.S. plans for the future of Syria. Analysts, including James Fallon at Control Risks in Dubai, have said that implementing the agreement could take years, allowing Assad to stay in power unless rebel forces topple him.
Practical Hurdles
Even if the deal born in Geneva succeeds in eliminating Assad’s entire stockpile of chemical weapons on the stated timetable, which is unlikely given the practical hurdles, that wouldn’t tip the balance of power against the Syrian leader, said a U.S. official who follows the Syrian conflict closely.
The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence reports, said yesterday that Assad’s arsenal of conventional weapons, especially artillery and air power, has accounted for more than 98 percent of the casualties the regime has inflicted in the war.
Syria ’s military has been resupplied by Iran and remains strong and united enough to overcome the divided and scattered rebel groups and maintain the regime’s hold on the capital, the Alawite heartland on Syria’s Mediterranean coast and a corridor between the two, the U.S. official added.
The official said that even if the chemical weapons agreement holds, Assad may have gotten a good deal by agreeing to give up his nerve gas and other chemical weapons and thus avoid a U.S. military strike that could have damaged his conventional arsenal and scattered and demoralized his troops.
Militant Rebels
In addition, the official said, internecine fighting among militant Islamic rebel groups, some with close ties to the Iraqi offshoot of al-Qaeda, and more moderate fighters has strengthened Assad’s hand and created new doubts about U.S. and European efforts to arm and train rebel groups.
In particular, the official said, two or three of the 13 rebel groups that defected to the extremists on Sept. 25 had been under consideration for receiving Western aid.
The Hague-based chemical weapons body is expected to adopt the U.S.-Russia plan by about 4 p.m. New York time, clearing the way for a Security Council vote, according to the U.K.’s UN ambassador, Mark Lyall Grant.

We’re Not Prepared to Police Chemical Weapons
By Dan Kaszeta
2013-09-26T19:40:22Z
We may never get to the bottom of what happened Aug. 21 in Ghouta, on the outskirts of Damascus. The report by United Nations inspectors concluded that rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used against civilians, including children, as well as combatants on a relatively large scale. Circumstantial evidence suggests Syrian government troops fired them, but the lack of proof has given the regime, and its backers in Russia , room to blame rebel forces.
For those of us who have long grappled with chemical weapons, the uncertainties present a familiar frustration. To this day, the world doesn’t know the full story of what happened in Halabja , Iraq , where the Saddam Hussein regime in 1988 killed uncounted thousands of Iraqi Kurds using unknown chemical weapons, or in Srebrenica, where allegations arose in 1995 that Bosniak survivors fleeing the city came under a chemical attack by Bosnian Serb forces.
There are lessons to learn from these ambiguities, ways civilized countries can make the use of chemical weapons more transparent so as to better deter would-be transgressors and hold guilty parties accountable.
First, we need to develop the capacity for “standoff” detection of chemical weapons. The world today has no tools to accurately recognize the dispersal of chemical warfare agents from a distance. The most useful detectors have to be present at the site of the attack, rather than on a drone or a satellite.
The intelligence agencies of the major powers need to be able to look at vapor clouds from a distance, perhaps shine a laser on them and be able to tell if sarin or VX, for example, had been used. Some great ideas and even a few embryonic technologies are out there; They need to be pushed from concept to laboratory to product.
Video Limitations
Second, we need to do a better job of video analytics. In the immediate aftermath of the Ghouta attack, the world was reduced to examining amateur video recordings to determine what did or did not happen. There are many limitations to this evidence, but even intelligence agencies, it seems, were relying on YouTube clips. Intelligence officials and other arbiters of truth, such as journalists, need to figure out better ways of gleaning time, place and medical details from video footage.
Third, we need to improve sample collection. In any conflict that affects as many interests as Syria ’s civil war, there are multitudes of spies. Agents working for Western parties should be trained, in the event of a chemical attack, to quickly collect solid, liquid, gas and blood samples that can be usefully analyzed.
Equipped with a sterile glass jar, an air-sampling bag and a thermal desorption tube -- standard gear for hazmat technicians and environmental crimes detectives -- spies could provide material more useful than 100 YouTube clips. Just one sample of the actual substance used on Aug. 21, collected at the time, would have saved weeks of speculation and mystery. Plus, there’s no guarantee that next time UN inspectors will gain access to a suspected chemical-attack site, especially given the consequences for Syria of the Ghouta massacre.
Better forensic evidence, produced more quickly, might have made a more powerful case that troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad were responsible for the attack. Although prosecution for war crimes is unimaginable with Russia protecting the regime, definitive proof might have humbled Assad, thereby discouraging Syria from violating a U.S.-Russian timeline for the destruction of its chemical-weapons program.
Destruction Capabilities
Even if the regime eagerly cooperates, it will be difficult to complete the plan by its deadline, the middle of next year. Syria is thought to possess more than 1,000 metric tons of chemical warfare agents and precursor chemicals. These materials can be safely destroyed only in specially constructed facilities, which don’t exist in Syria. Transporting weapons for destruction poses the risk of horrific chemical accidents and diversion by terrorists.
In this respect, Syria’s example offers another lesson: We need to investigate the value of building a large, mobile chemical-weapons demilitarization plant. Small mobile systems exist, but none that could rapidly destroy Syria’s arsenal.
The plant could be ship-based, like the two emergency hospitals the U.S. Navy dispatches to disaster zones around the world. Better yet would be a system that could go anywhere, including land-locked areas. Its components could be flown in 40-foot cargo containers to where it is needed and assembled on the spot, just like field hospitals and forensic laboratories.
It would be naive to think that once Syria’s chemical arms are cleaned up, there will be no need for such a facility. In the event of civil war or regime collapse in North Korea , we may face an urgent situation there; the U.S. thinks the country has significant chemical-weapons stores. Sometimes stockpiles turn up with no warning. Albania unveiled in 2005 that it had discovered 16 tons of sulfur mustard hidden away by its Marxist dictatorship in the 1970s.
The world will almost certainly be shocked by chemical weapons again. The least we can do is a better job preparing for it.

Syria Chemical-Arms Resolution Passes UN Security Council
By Sangwon Yoon & Nicole Gaouette - 2013-09-28T04:01:00Z
The United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a breakthrough agreement to eliminate all of Syria ’s chemical weapons.
The council voted 15-0 last night to adopt a resolution drafted by the U.S., the U.K. and France in response to an Aug. 21 poison gas attack near Damascus that killed more than 1,400 people. The resolution lacks immediate consequences if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad fails to comply and it doesn’t assign blame for the attack, which U.S., U.K. and French officials attribute to Assad’s regime.
Russia , a Syrian ally, has said rebels were responsible for the attack and blocked tougher wording in the resolution. Russian vetoes of previous UN attempts to sanction Assad made last night’s vote the first diplomatic breakthrough at the UN since Syria’s civil war began 2 1/2 years ago.
“For many months, I have said that the confirmed use of chemical weapons in Syria required a firm, united and decisive response,” UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters after the session. “Tonight, the international community has delivered.”
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Syria must “give unfettered access” to its chemical-weapons stockpile and will face repercussions if it fails to comply. Those responsible for the use of such munitions will be punished, he said.
‘Heinous Act’
“This resolution makes clear that those responsible for this heinous act must be held accountable,” Kerry told the Security Council after the vote. “We are here because actions have consequences and now, should the regime fail to act, there will be consequences.”
As a next step, Ban said the UN will seek to convene peace talks by mid-November between Assad’s government and opposition representatives.
U.K. Foreign Minister William Hague said Syria also must provide “unfettered access” to humanitarian relief efforts seeking to aid civilians suffering from the impact of war.
Bashar Jaafari, Syria’s UN ambassador, told reporters after the vote that his government is “on board” and committed to helping chemical-weapons inspectors and ensuring their safety. Syria is “fully committed” to peace talks, Jaafari said.
Destruction Accord
The Security Council voted after the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the world body in The Hague that monitors compliance with a global treaty banning the munitions, adopted a blueprint to verify, remove, and destroy Assad’s arsenal of sarin and other chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The chemical weapons organization’s 41-nation executive council spent almost two weeks in closed-door discussions as the U.S., its allies and Russia debated the text of the UN resolution. A U.S. official who spoke on condition of not being identified said it was crucial for the Netherlands-based group’s plan to be complete before the Security Council vote because the two documents complement each other.
The organization in The Hague said its executive council agreed on an “accelerated program” for the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons and related material and will begin inspections in Syria by Oct. 1.
“This decision sends an unmistakable message that the international community is coming together to work for peace in Syria, beginning with the elimination of chemical weapons in that country,” OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said in a statement.
Taking Custody
One complication emerged even before last night’s vote, when Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov announced on Sept. 26 that while Moscow is willing to help guard chemical-weapons sites in Syria, it won’t take custody of Syria’s munitions, the state-run RIA news agency reported.
Only Russia and the U.S. have the industrial-scale capacity to store and incinerate chemical weapons safely. Since the U.S. bans importing and transporting such munitions, Russia’s announcement means the inspectors will have to work inside Syria amid the civil war there.
“It is hard to imagine chemical-weapons inspectors, protected by Russian or other troops, engaging in the complicated task of destroying the stockpiles of chemical weapons in the midst of a civil war,” William Keylor, who teaches international relations at Boston University , said by e-mail. “If the inspectors or their protectors come under fire from either side, what will the response of the international community be?”
‘First Step’
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Syria’s cooperation “must be unconditional and fully transparent.”
“This resolution is not our final goal, but only a first step,” Fabius said, according to an English translation of his remarks to the Security Council. “We must now implement it. One cannot trust a regime, which, until recently, denied possessing such weapons.”
In Congress, lawmakers expressed skepticism about Syria’s and Russia’s commitment to the deal.
Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina said the UN accord doesn’t change the reality on the ground and fails to include a credible threat of force.
“This resolution is another triumph of hope over reality,” McCain and Graham said in a statement. “It contains no meaningful or immediate enforcement mechanisms, let alone a threat of the use of force for the Assad regime’s noncompliance. The whole question of enforcement has been deferred.”
‘Wanton Violence’
Senator Robert Menendez , the New Jersey Democrat who leads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed concern before the vote that the focus has shifted from ending “the barbarism and wanton violence of the Assad regime” to removing one method it uses to attack its own people.
“A red light for one form of weapons does not mean a green light for others,” Ban said. This is not a license to kill with conventional weapons. All the violence must stop. All the guns must fall silent.”
At a news briefing in New York earlier yesterday, Ahmad al-Jarba, a Syrian opposition leader, said the chemical-weapons accord won’t end the suffering in Syria.
The UN action follows two weeks of whirlwind diplomacy after Russia and the U.S. reached an agreement in Geneva to avert an American military strike against Syria if Assad agreed to relinquish his poison-gas arsenal.
Accomplishing More
“Our original objective was to degrade and deter Syria’s chemical-weapons capability,” and a U.S. attack “could have achieved that,” Kerry said. “Tonight’s resolution accomplishes even more,” by moving to eliminate “one of the largest chemical-weapons stockpiles on earth.”
The UN resolution states that Syria “shall not use, develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons, or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to other states or non-state actors.”
If Syria doesn’t comply or participates in “unauthorized transfer of chemical weapons,” or if there is “any use of chemical weapons by anyone in the Syrian Arab Republic,” the Security Council can move to “impose measures under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter.”
The Security Council then would discuss alleged violations, with individual members able to present their own intelligence on the event. Permanent members, such as Russia, can veto any final decision.
Using Force
The charter’s Chapter 7 allows the UN to take action, including the use of force, in response to acts of aggression or threats against peace.
“The language of the resolution is less important than Russia’s willingness to make Assad comply,” Richard Gowan , associate director of New York University’s Center on International Cooperation, said by e-mail. “The whole deal still pivots on Moscow’s commitment to making it work.”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the resolution “does not allow for any automatic use of force or measures of enforcement” for compliance failures by Syria. He said the Security Council would have to “carefully” consider any decisions on enforcement.
U.S. officials say that President Barack Obama reserves the right to conduct a strike without UN approval.
Even if the deal born in Geneva succeeds in eliminating Assad’s chemical-weapons stockpile on the stated timetable, which is unlikely given the practical hurdles, it wouldn’t tip the balance of power against the Syrian leader, said a second U.S. official, who follows the Syrian conflict closely.
Adequate Weapons
The official, who spoke on the condition of not being identified in discussing intelligence reports, said that Assad’s arsenal of conventional weapons, especially artillery and air power, has accounted for more than 98 percent of the casualties the regime has inflicted in the war.
That has created anger among opposition groups that think the West hasn’t supplied them with the arms they need to fight back, said Benjamin Weinthal, a fellow with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington who is doing research inside Syria on the opposition.
“There’s not just anger at the West,” Weinthal said by telephone from the Syrian-Turkey border, “but real fury at how Russia, Hezbollah, Iran , China have betrayed them” with their support for the regime.
Syria’s military has been resupplied by Iran, the U.S. official said. Assad’s forces remain strong and united enough to overcome divided and scattered rebel groups and maintain their hold on the capital, the Alawite heartland on the Mediterranean coast and a corridor between the two, the official said.
Even if the chemical-weapons accord holds, the official said that Assad may have gotten a good deal by agreeing to give up his nerve gas and other such munitions and thus avoid a U.S. military strike that could have damaged his conventional arsenal and scattered and demoralized his troops.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama says a deal reached on a United Nations resolution to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons is ‘‘potentially a huge victory for the international community.’’
The draft resolution’s demands that Syria abandon its chemical stockpile and allow unfettered access to chemical weapons experts are legally binding. But if Syria fails to comply, the council will need to adopt a second resolution to impose consequences.
Obama said during an Oval Office meeting with India’s prime minister that he is ‘‘very hopeful for the prospects of what can be accomplished.’’
He applauded a framework that is legally binding, verifiable and enforceable. And he argued his threat of military strikes was crucial to reaching the agreement, but he always preferred a diplomatic solution.

The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have agreed on a resolution that will require Syria to give up its chemical weapons, but the text will not threaten the use of force for a failure to comply, officials said.
The office of the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, announced the deal. But the final version, which was to be discussed by the full 15-member Security Council on Thursday night, was not written under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, the strongest form of a council resolution because it can be enforced with military action.
That is a compromise with Russia, the Syrian government’s most powerful defender, which had said from the outset it would oppose a Chapter VII resolution, as it has repeatedly done throughout the divided Security Council’s efforts to forge a consensus on resolving the Syrian conflict.
The final draft also does not ascribe specific blame for the Aug. 21 attack that asphyxiated hundreds of Syrians near Damascus, Syria, another compromise with the Russians, who have repeatedly said they believe that Syrian insurgents carried it out.
Still, diplomats said, the final draft does express the Security Council’s “strong conviction” that those found responsible for chemical weapons use in the Syrian conflict should be held accountable. Before the Security Council votes on the measure, an organization in The Hague will have to determine procedures for ridding Syria of its chemical weapons.
The draft resolution’s compliance provision is modeled along the agreement reached nearly two weeks ago by Russia and the United States that commits Syria to surrender its chemical weapons by the middle of 2014. In the event Syria fails to comply, the draft asserts, the Security Council would then reconvene to impose unspecified measures under Chapter VII.
Diplomats said incomplete components of the resolution included precisely how Syria’s weapons stockpile would be destroyed, partly because the Security Council was still awaiting a document from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the group based in The Hague that monitors the Chemical Weapons Convention. But the Russians have said they would insist that the banned munitions must be destroyed inside Syria.
Russia Today, a government-run news website, quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov on Thursday as saying that Russian forces could be used in guarding chemical weapons facilities where dismantling and destruction work was carried out. He also suggested that other members of the Chemical Weapons Convention should “seriously consider the possibility of taking part in this process.”

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The five permanent members of the deeply divided U.N. Security Council reached agreement Thursday on a resolution to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons, a major step in taking the most controversial weapon off the battlefield of the world’s deadliest ongoing conflict.
The draft resolution’s demands that Syria abandon its chemical stockpile and allow unfettered access to chemical weapons experts are legally binding. But if Syria fails to comply, the council will need to adopt a second resolution to impose measures under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows for military and nonmilitary actions to promote peace and security.
Nonetheless, after 2 1/2 years of inaction and paralysis, the agreement represents a breakthrough for the Security Council and rare unity between Russia, which supports Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government, and the United States, which backs the opposition.
Russia and the United States jointly introduced the text to the 10 non-permanent council members Thursday night, supported by the other permanent members, Britain, France and China. A vote on the resolution depends on how the full council responds to the draft, and on how soon an international group that oversees the global treaty on chemical weapons can adopt a plan for securing and destroying Syria’s stockpile.
The Russia, U.S. and British ambassadors said the executive board of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons may meet Friday in The Hague, Netherlands to agree on a document setting out its exact duties. This would enable the Security Council to possibly vote late Friday at the earliest, the ambassadors said.
The U.N. resolution will include the text of the OPCW’s declaration and make it legally binding, so the OPCW must act first.
The spark for the recent flurry of diplomatic activity was the Aug. 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb, and President Barack Obama’s threat of U.S. strikes in retaliation.
After U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Assad could avert U.S. military action by turning over ‘‘every single bit of his chemical weapons’’ to international control within a week, Russia quickly agreed. Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signed an agreement in Geneva on Sept. 13 to put Syria’s chemical weapons under international control for later destruction, and Assad’s government accepted.
‘‘Just two weeks ago, tonight’s outcome seemed utterly unimaginable,’’ U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power told reporters after the Security Council meeting. ‘‘Two weeks ago the Syrian regime had not even acknowledged the existence of its chemical weapons stockpiles.’’
She said the resolution’s adoption would mark the first time since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011 that the council has imposed binding obligations on Syria of any kind.
‘‘If implemented fully, this resolution will eliminate one of the largest previously undeclared chemical weapons programs in the world,’’ Power said.
Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant and a senior U.S. State Department official described the draft resolution as ‘‘binding and enforceable.’’
But the draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, makes clear there is no trigger for enforcement measures if Syria fails to comply. The Russian, U.S. and British ambassadors confirmed that this would require a second resolution. But Lyall Grant said the strong language in the text — that the council ‘‘decides’’ that the Security Council will ‘‘impose measures under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter’’ in the event of non-compliance — requires members to act.
Negotiations on the draft resolution were tough, especially on the Chapter 7 issue.  Russia and China have vetoed three previous Western-backed resolutions aimed at pressuring Assad to end the violence, but the chemical weapons attack proved to be a turning point.
Lyall Grant called the draft ‘‘a groundbreaking text’’ because for the first time it would make a determination that ‘‘use of chemical weapons anywhere constitutes a threat to international peace and security,’’ which sets a new international norm.
In a clear reference to Russia, he added, ‘‘if Assad thought he could hide behind certain members of the Security Council, he will have to think again.’’
Lyall Grant said there were compromises and Britain would have liked much stronger language on the abuse of human rights by the regime and a decision by the council to refer perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks to the International Criminal Court to be prosecuted for war crimes. Diplomats said this was discussed but Russia objected. Continued...

UN-Backed Effort to Rid Syria of Chemical Weapons Faces Hurdles
By Terry Atlas September 28, 2013
International inspectors are due to get their first look at Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles within days, implementing a United Nations-backed plan to secure and destroy the deadly arsenal amid a civil war.
The Organization for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons plans to have inspections begin by Oct. 1 on a fast-tracked schedule to deny Syrian President Bashar al-Assad the use of his mustard gas and nerve agents. It envisions eliminating all Syria’s chemical weapons and related materials by mid-2014.
It’s the first time the Netherlands-based organization has undertaken such a task in a war zone. In addition to security, the plan faces hurdles that include U.S. and other countries’ doubts about Assad’s intentions and questions of where and how the weapons and related materials will be destroyed.
“Rightly, people have been concerned about whether Syria will follow through on the commitments that have been laid forth,” U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters yesterday at the White House. “And I think there are legitimate concerns as to how, technically, we’re going to be getting those chemical weapons out while there’s still fighting going on.”
Assad will quickly be tested by inspections, and the chemical weapons organization’s 41-nation Executive Council agreed to meet within 24 hours after any Syrian violations to consider referring the matter to the UN Security Council.
Destruction Milestones
It’s unclear where and how Syria’s weapons and precursor chemicals will be destroyed. The executive council, which yesterday approved a directive on Syria, didn’t provide details. The council plans to set “destruction milestones” no later than Nov. 15, after a first wave of inspections.
“I think the council wants a better picture of Syria’s arsenal and stockpile locations before establishing a time line that it might need to walk back at a future date,” said James Lewis, communications director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, a Washington research group.
The OPCW is seeking contributions from member nations to help the organization and the Syrian government cover the “significant” costs, Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said in a statement yesterday. “Never before has the OPCW faced a task of this magnitude and importance.”
While “no one underestimates the obstacles,” the timetable seems achievable, particularly given Russia’s backing and broad international support, said Joseph Cirincione, an arms-control analyst who’s president of the Ploughshares Fund, a San Francisco-based security foundation.
War Zone
“The very good news is that it looks like much of this arsenal can be quickly destroyed,” he said in an interview.
The OPCW is breaking with past actions by sending inspectors into a war zone. The group suspended activities in Libya when the civil war there broke out in February 2011.
“Because Syria is in the midst of civil war, there are many risk factors that have not been present in past cases of chemical weapons destruction such as in Libya or Iraq,” according to a Sept. 12 report by the Congressional Research Service.
The U.S. blames the Assad regime for an Aug. 21 attack using sarin gas, citing more than 1,400 deaths, a quarter of them children. Assad denies responsibility and, echoed by Russia, blames “terrorist” rebels despite evidence from a UN team implicating regime forces. Obama threatened military strikes before backing off once U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reached a deal Sept. 14 in Geneva to eliminate Assad’s chemical weapons.
Large Arsenal
Assad agreed to join the Chemical Weapons Convention and give up his arsenal. It was the first time that Syria acknowledged it has chemical munitions, providing an initial inventory as required to the OPCW, the international body that implements the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention banning such munitions.
Syria is believed to have one of the world’s largest such arsenals, including mustard gas, which had horrific consequences during trench warfare in World War I, and more advanced sarin and VX nerve agents, lethal offshoots of insecticides. Its program is “large, complex, and geographically dispersed,” according to the U.S. intelligence community’s  2013 Worldwide Threat Assessment.
The U.S. has attempted to monitor Syria’s chemical weapons during the civil war by focusing surveillance on suspected stockpile sites and movements, according to U.S. officials who weren’t authorized to discuss intelligence matters.
1,000 Metric Tons
The lack of firm knowledge about Assad’s weapons -- which a UN official has said are under the control of elite military units led by his brother Maher -- was reflected in the Geneva negotiations: Kerry and Lavrov could do no better than agree on an estimate of 1,000 metric tons of chemical weapons and precursor chemicals.
Syria has “thousands of munitions” that can be used to deliver chemical weapons, the White House said in an Aug. 30 statement. Those range from bombs and artillery rockets to Scud missiles.
Syria is “determined to go forward” in giving up chemical weapons, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem told Al Jazeera television yesterday at the United Nations.
The OPCW Executive Council said Syria must provide a more detailed inventory by Oct. 4. Among other things, that accounting will show whether the regime has munitions that match those used in the Aug. 21 attack.
‘Unfettered’ Inspections
The OPCW will attempt to verify that the information Syria provides is accurate and that Assad isn’t copying the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who played hide-and-seek with UN weapons inspectors during the 1990s before he eliminated his chemical and biological weapons.
The OPCW directed inspectors to visit all of Syria’s declared chemical weapons facilities in the next 30 days. Beyond those, the OPCW demands that the secretive Assad regime permit “immediate and unfettered” inspections at “any and all sites,” including those based on information provided by other nations such as the U.S.
Syria must provide access “to any and all sites and any and all people” sought by inspectors, Kerry said at the UN Security Council yesterday, as the council voted unanimously to back the OPCW plan.
To prevent delay and obstruction by Assad, the OPCW executive council said that only the group’s director-general can block an inspection, in effect preventing Syria from using the time-consuming challenge process permitted other nations.
November Target
As called for in the Sept. 14 Geneva agreement by Kerry and Lavrov, the OPCW set a November target date for completing the destruction of all chemical weapons production and mixing or filling equipment, effectively capping nerve gas stocks.
The Kerry-Lavrov accord called for the the removal of the “largest amounts of weapons feasible, under OPCW supervision, and their destruction outside Syria.” The possibility that Russia would transfer the chemicals to its destruction facilities was ruled out Sept. 26 by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, according to Russian state broadcaster RT.
“There’s no doubt, we won’t do it,” Ryabkov said, adding that the materials and equipment should be destroyed in Syria.
Chemical weapons can be destroyed by neutralization or incineration, which generally requires building special facilities to reduce the risk of accidental contamination and danger to nearby populations.
About a third of Syria’s weapons are thought to be mustard gas, which can be chemically neutralized, and the nerve-agent precursor chemicals don’t post a threat until they’re mixed, said Cirincione. Destroying stocks of VX and sarin by incineration is the most difficult.
Short Timetable
By putting the weapons under monitoring, destroying mixing equipment and removing precursor chemicals, “you’ve effectively destroyed the chemical arsenal, even if some of it takes a little longer” to eliminate, said Cirincione.
The OPCW’s timetable for Syria is a very short compared to others. Both the U.S. and Russia have stockpiles not yet destroyed. Albania got attention in 2007 when it completed the destruction of about 16 metric tons of Cold War-vintage chemical arms, 10 years after it joined the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Under the convention, countries are responsible for paying destruction costs. Assad, in a Sept. 18 Fox News interview, said he’s been told that it may take about a year and cost as much as $1 billion to destroy the chemical arsenal, indicating others would need to help cover the costs.
U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday said his country will make an initial contribution of $3 million to the OPCW trust fund and urged other countries to donate to the Syria effort, which will be expensive.
The OPCW council, without providing a cost estimate, appealed for financial contributions from nations “in a position to do so,” and authorized hiring an unspecified number of inspectors, technical experts and other personnel to meet new staffing needs.

Turkey’s Gul Says Syria Strike Must Be ‘Last Resort’ After Talks
By Jeff Kearns September 29, 2013
Turkish President Abdullah Gul said military action against neighboring Syria should be an option only if diplomatic efforts fail to spur President Bashar al-Assad to surrender chemical weapons he used on civilians.
“Military action is the last resort,” Gul said on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” show. “But what we insisted, there should be a comprehensive political strategy first. I think this is missing from the very beginning.”
The administration of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has backed the Syrian rebels in their efforts to topple Assad, whose forces conducted an Aug. 21 sarin nerve gas attack near Damascus that the U.S. says killed more than 1,400 people. President Barack Obama said last week in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York that there “must be a strong Security Council resolution to verify that the Assad regime” is keeping its commitments to give up chemical weapons.
Gul said “we should not fool ourselves” that efforts to get Assad to abandon chemical weapons will work without the threat of military force to implement his agreements.
“If it’s going to be real cleaning, that will be wonderful,” Gul said, according to a transcript provided by CNN. “That will be good for everyone. But if it’s going to be given some time, that at the end, still there will be some chemical weapons there, so that it would be a loss of time.”
Syrian Refugees
The two-year civil war between forces loyal to Assad and Syrian rebels has taken at least 100,000 lives and created more than 1.5 million refugees, according to UN estimates. Many of those fled across the 900-kilometer (560-mile) Turkish border and have been sheltered by the Turks.
The Syrian conflict “is not the problem of Turkey, first of all, but we are the neighbor,” Gul said. “What’s happening in Syria is having immediate consequences on Turkey.”
The UN Security Council unanimously approved on Sept. 27 a resolution agreeing to eliminate all of Syria’s toxic arsenal. The resolution lacks immediate consequences if the Assad regime fails to comply.
The resolution also doesn’t assign blame for the attack, which U.S., U.K. and French officials attribute to Assad. Syria’s ally Russia, which has used its Security Council veto power to protect Assad, has said rebels were responsible for the attack and blocked tougher wording in the resolution.

U.N. General Assembly begins under Syrian storm clouds
A senior Obama administration official called it "binding and enforceable," as did U.K. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power. But another diplomat involved in the negotiations said "it is strong language, but it is not a Chapter 7 resolution...it is a compromise. Why the Americans began to say that the Geneva agreement envisioned a Chapter 7 resolution is not easy to understand. This agreement says that the Council returns for an enforceable resolution only if Assad does not comply."
Obama: "Insult to human reason" to say Assad wasn't behind Syria attack
In the important operative clauses, the resolution "determines that the use of chemical weapons anywhere constitutes a threat to international peace and security," which uses the stronger language (determine) and establishes a new benchmark; it condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria and, in particular, the attack on August 21 as a violation of international law (not blaming the Assad government in particular); and it prohibits Syria from using, developing, acquiring, stockpiling, retaining or transferring chemical weapons to other nations or groups. It adds that all parties in Syria are under the same restrictions.
The resolution puts concrete measures into effect by authorizing an advance team of United Nations personnel to provide early assistance to OPCW activities in Syria and requires those involved in the implementation of the resolution to submit to the Council within 10 days of the adoption of the resolution recommendations regarding the role of the United Nations in eliminating Syria's chemical weapons program and requests the OPCW to report to the Security Council within 30 days and every month any non-compliance.
Obama: No U.S. interest in Syria "beyond the well-being of its people"
Without a specific reference to an international tribunal, the resolution expresses its "strong conviction" that individuals responsible for the chemical weapons attacks should be held accountable, and it endorses the concept of a Geneva international conference to establish a transitional governing body with full executive powers.
Finally, it states in strong language (in U.N. terms, "decide" is an action term), that if Syria does not comply with the terms of the resolution, the Council will return to impose measures under the use of force -- Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter.
The appendices lay out more agreed upon terms to commit the parties to the conflict in Syria to a cessation of armed violence and set forth methods that would allow for humanitarian access.
Along with an historic high level meeting with Iran -- a supporter of the Assad government -- and some progress in Middle East talks, the Syria resolution represents diplomatic progress for the Obama administration, although time will tell if these initiatives work. The next difficult step will be getting the parties in Syria to sit down to negotiate in Geneva.

Syria says chemical weapons resolution applies to all parties
U.S., Russia warn of consequences if Syria does not abide to resolution
Kerry says world community imposing binding obligation on Syria
Another body agrees to fast-track Syria entry into Chemical Weapons Convention
United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council, capping a dramatic month of diplomacy, voted unanimously late Friday to require Syria to eliminate its arsenal of chemical weapons -- or face consequences.
"Today's resolution will ensure that the elimination of the Syrian chemical weapons program happens as soon as possible and with the utmost transparency and accountability," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.
The U.N. resolution was based on a deal struck this month between the United States and Russia that averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb that U.S. officials said left at least 1,400 people dead.
The resolution did not authorize the automatic use of force if Syria is said to be in violation, as was previously sought by the United States.
The 15-member Security Council met shortly after the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons , or OPCW, voted to fast-track Syria's addition to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans such weapons.
Bill Clinton on Putin and Syria
U.S., Russia reach deal on Syria
Extremists gain influence among rebels
For nearly two years, the U.N. Security Council had been unable to reach a consensus over what to do to bring about an end to Syria's civil war. Russia and China repeatedly vetoed resolutions dating back to October 2011 that condemned President Bashar al-Assad's government and called for him to step down.
The turnaround came this month, when Russia called for Syria to divest itself of its chemical weapons arsenal after U.S. President Barack Obama accused Syria of crossing a "red line" with the use of nerve gas and threatened a strike.
Syria announced this month that it was willing to join the agreement.
A binding obligation
Both the United States and Russia warned that if Syria failed to adhere to the terms of the U.N. resolution, it would face consequences.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the world community was imposing a binding obligation on the government of al-Assad to get rid of its stockpile.
"This resolution makes clear that those responsible for this heinous act must be held accountable," said Kerry.
If the resolution succeeds, the world "will have eliminated one of the largest chemical weapon arsenals on Earth, eliminating it from one of the most volatile places on Earth," Kerry said.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the council that his country, long an ally of the Syrian government, "will stand ready to take action" if the resolution needs enforcement.
By agreeing to dismantle its chemical weapons program and provide documentation of its arsenal, "Damascus has shown its readiness to cooperate," said Lavrov.
Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Jaafari said the resolution holds all parties in Syria accountable for the use of chemical weapons.
Inspectors return to Syria
U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Syria this week to look into at least a half-dozen claims of chemical weapons use -- some allegedly by the government, others allegedly by rebels.
U.N. inspectors have already confirmed the use of chemical warfare in the rural Damascus suburb of Ateibeh in August, but have not explicitly said who was responsible.
The al-Assad government has repeatedly accused rebels of using chemical weapons, an assertion that has been widely dismissed by most Western leaders.
The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 people have died since March 2011 when a brutal government crackdown against protesters devolved into an all-out civil war.
The Security Council vote followed action by the executive council of the OPCW, meeting in the Netherlands. That group adopted its measure by consensus in about 10 minutes.
"We now have a legal mandate to start a verification mission in Syria," OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan.
The OPCW agreed to an "accelerated program for achieving the complete elimination of Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014," it said in a statement. Inspections in Syria will begin Tuesday.
"The decision also calls for ambitious milestones for destruction, which will be set by the council by 15 November," the organization said.
Obama: 'Very hopeful'
Obama, speaking before the votes, said he was "very hopeful" about the developments, but warned much work remains to be done.
"I think, rightly, people have been concerned about whether Syria will follow through on the commitments that have been laid forth and I think there are legitimate concerns as to how technically we are going to be getting those chemical weapons out while there's still fighting going on the ground," Obama said.
Obama said the threat of U.S. military power pushed Syrian leaders to agree to destroy their chemical weapons and said the resolution "not only deters and prevents additional chemical use but actually goes beyond what could have been accomplished through any military action."
The OPCW plans to send an advance team of inspectors to Damascus, an official with the organization, who declined to be identified while discussing delicate operations, told CNN on Friday.
The official said that in order to meet international deadlines for destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, the group may opt for a "quick and dirty" program that would render the weapons unusable but wouldn't destroy them, the official said.
U.S. official: Syrian CW list more complete than anticipated
'Not a license to kill'
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has said his country is willing to transport and destroy Syrian chemical weapons, although only as part of an international coalition.
Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier in September took to The New York Times to argue against military intervention in Syria.
Striking Syria would have many negative ramifications, Putin argued in the piece, including the killing of innocent people, spreading violence around the Middle East, clouding diplomatic efforts to address Iran's nuclear crisis and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and "unleash(ing) a new wave of terrorism."
In his remarks Friday night, Ban called on both the Syrian government and rebels to stop the fighting.
"As we mark this important step, we must never forget that the catalog of horrors in Syria continues with bombs and tanks, grenades and guns," he said. "A red light for one form of weapons does not mean a green light for others. This is not a license to kill with conventional weapons."
Syria submits 'initial disclosure' of chemical weapons program
'No meaningful enforcement mechanisms'
Two Republican U.S. senators criticized the Security Council vote, saying it will do little to end the civil war.
"This resolution is another triumph of hope over reality," John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a statement. "It contains no meaningful or immediate enforcement mechanisms, let alone a threat of the use of force for the Assad regime's noncompliance."
The pair said al-Assad's forces will continue to "use every weapon in their arsenal short of chemical weapons" on the Syrian people while receiving outside assistance from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah while doing so.

Syria chemical weapons team to probe nearly 50 sites
From CNN's Nick Patton Walsh
September 28, 2013 -- Updated 1513 GMT (2313 HKT)
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Official: may "potentially" need to seek third party troops
Initial inspections team will consist of twenty people, based in Damascus
Official: slightly fewer than 50 chemical weapons sites
Some sites will require travel through rebel held areas
(CNN) -- When inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons arrive in Damascus on Monday they'll face a daunting task. They'll need to visit nearly 50 different sites as part of the effort to rid Syria of its chemical weapons.
That news comes from an official with the OPCW who says some of the locations are near contested areas, and that to access some of the locations will require travel through rebel held areas.
Even with the go-ahead from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the conditions, including active combat, raise logistical concerns.
The OPCW says it may "potentially" need to seek third party troops (not Syrian, or OPCW), to assist with security during the mission. The official went on to say that the team will initially consist of 20 people based in Damascus.

Friday evening, the full 15-member United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to control and then destroy such weapons, which UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said was “the first hopeful news on Syria in a long time.”
In the world of international diplomacy – especially regarding disarmament involving weapons of mass destruction – the steps leading to this latest development came with head-spinning speed.
RECOMMENDED: Briefing Chemical weapons 101: Six facts about sarin and Syria’s stockpile
Just a few weeks ago, the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad refused to acknowledge that it had chemical weapons, even though there was strong evidence that regime forces killed hundreds of civilians in a large-scale chemical attack Aug. 21 in a Damascus suburb aimed at rebels fighting in Syria’s long and costly civil war.
When President Obama threatened to punish the regime with a limited military attack, positioning US Navy destroyers within cruise missile range, Secretary of State John Kerry made what seemed to be an off-hand comment to the effect that Assad could avoid such an attack by turning over “every single bit of his chemical weapons” to international control.
Within hours, Russia – Syria’s chief ally – picked up on Kerry’s suggestion, and Syria quickly agreed to such disarmament. Within days, Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had worked out an agreement which lays out a path and a time frame for removing or destroying all of Syria’s chemical weapons and equipment in a year’s time.
The UN Security Council vote Friday came just hours after the world's chemical weapons watchdog – the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) – adopted the US-Russian plan, which lays out benchmarks and timelines for cataloguing, quarantining, and ultimately destroying Syria's chemical weapons, their precursors and delivery systems.
The agreement allows the start of a mission to rid Syria's regime of its estimated 1,000-ton chemical arsenal by mid-2014, significantly accelerating a destruction timetable that often takes years to complete.
"We expect to have an advance team on the ground [in Syria] next week," OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan told reporters at the organization's headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands immediately after its 41-member executive council approved the plan.
Meeting with reporters in the White House briefing room as the Security Council was preparing to vote, President Obama called this latest development on Syria’s chemical weapons “a major diplomatic breakthrough.”
“This binding resolution will ensure that the Assad regime must keep its commitments, or face consequences,” he said. “We’ll have to be vigilant about following through, but this could be a significant victory for the international community, and demonstrate how strong diplomacy can allow us to secure our country and pursue a better world.”
Kerry emphasized that the Security Council resolution is legally binding and can be enforced.
“Syria cannot select or reject the inspectors,” Kerry said. “Syria must give those inspectors unfettered access to any and all sites and any and all people.”
“Should the regime fail to act, there will be consequences," he said.  
The resolution does anticipate the possibility of economic or military consequences should Syria refuse to comply or otherwise delay implementation. But that would require another Security Council vote, which Syria’s ally Russia could veto.
Critics see that as a serious weakness.
"It contains no meaningful or immediate enforcement mechanisms, let alone a threat of the use of force for the Assad regime's non-compliance,” Senators John McCain (R) of Arizona and Lindsey Graham (R) of South Carolina said in a statement. “The whole question of enforcement has been deferred.”
"In the weeks and months ahead, Assad and his forces will continue their war on the Syrian people,” the Senators warned. “They will continue to use every weapon in their arsenal short of chemical weapons. They will continue to slaughter tens of thousands of Syrian men, women, and children." 
But those viewing the latest developments more optimistically see the possibility of broader benefits.
In the resolution approved Friday, the Security Council for the first time endorsed the roadmap for a political transition in Syria adopted by key nations in June 2012 and called for an international conference to be convened "as soon as possible" to implement it.
Secretary-General Ban said the target date for a new peace conference in Geneva is mid-November.

The resolution, which still must be adopted by the full 15-member council, includes a provision stating that “the use of chemical weapons anywhere constitutes a threat to international peace and security.” That language in effect puts rogue states and militant organizations on notice that the world’s powers will not tolerate chemical weapons use anywhere.
“That language has meaning,” says a senior State Department official, calling it the first time the world’s security body will be defining chemical weapons as such a threat to “international order” that their use should entail consequences.
RECOMMENDED: Briefing Chemical weapons 101: Six facts about sarin and Syria’s stockpile
The resolution, which could be approved as early as Friday evening, when the full Security Council is scheduled to meet, establishes a “new norm” against the use of chemical weapons, says Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN.
Yet while that may ultimately figure as a significant step for the world, the resolution also has its winners and losers as it pertains specifically to Syria and its deadly civil war, international affairs experts and some officials say.
Russia is a clear winner and even Syrian President Bashar al-Assad comes out better than might have been expected a few weeks ago, when President Obama was threatening imminent military action to punish the Assad regime over a large-scale chemical weapons attack outside Damascus on Aug. 21. Now Mr. Assad is in effect enlisted as a partner in what could turn out to be a year-long effort to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons.
But the US – which insists that addressing the Syria crisis, from the chemical weapons to the broader civil war, is not a zero-sum game – is also registering its wins.
The resolution will bind the UN and the Security Council to the Syria crisis in a way that Russia has resisted up to now. After many acrimonious debates and three vetoed Syria resolutions since the war started in March 2011, the council is now affirming the role it has to play in Syria.
Calling the resolution “utterly unimaginable” a few weeks ago, Ambassador Power cites the significance of council action that for the first time will impose any kind of binding obligations on Syria.
But that does not mean the US is getting everything it wanted.
Most glaringly, the resolution does not include a trigger for automatic consequences – in the form of military action or sanctions, for example – in the event of noncompliance. That is a victory for Russia, which refused to accept language sought by the US and other Western powers that would have enforced automatic penalties over any breach by Syria of its agreement to give up its chemical weapons.
The resolution states that “in the event of noncompliance with this resolution, including unauthorized transfer of chemical weapons, or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in the Syrian Arab Republic,” the Security Council can decide to “impose measures under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter.”
What that means is that the Council could decide to enforce the resolution with military action or sanctions, but such action would require a second resolution from the council. And Russia, which has vetoed any resolutions targeting the Assad regime over the course of the 2-1/2-year-old civil war, is likely to do the same over any future enforcement measures, most Russia analysts say.
US officials insist the resolution is worded in a way to guarantee accountability for any breach. “This resolution makes clear there will be consequences for noncompliance,” Power said Thursday night.
But some critics condemn the resolution as a backing down by the US and the West that could send the wrong signal not just to Mr. Assad but to other countries in the region.
“While we all want a verifiable diplomatic solution to Syria’s chemical weapons, the lack of enforcement measures makes me highly skeptical of Russia’s willingness to impose real consequences on Syria for noncompliance,” says Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee.
Sounding leery of potential repercussions from a resolution without automatic triggers, he says, “It’s important that we reinforce our broader national interests for stability in Syria and reassure our allies of US resolve to counter other threats, especially from Iran.”
More broadly, the Syria resolution advances the global ban on chemical weapons – which Obama likes to say is honored by 98 percent of the world – by ultimately eliminating one of the largest remaining stockpiles. 
And it gives a new higher profile to the UN agency that oversees implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1925. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, will be responsible for the mission that inspects and then destroys Syria’s stockpiles.
The OPCW’s executive council in The Hague was expected to finalize a document as early as Friday outlining the many complex ­– and in the case of Syria, which is in the midst of a civil war, dangerous – steps the agency must undertake in Syria.
Once that’s approved, the Security Council is then expected to quickly approve its resolution giving international legal backing to the plan.
That will be a step that both Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin can claim as a victory: Obama, because he has promoted the prohibition and ultimate destruction of all weapons of mass destruction from the outset of his presidency; and Putin, because he has one eye on extremist separatist groups in Russia, and in part because of that shares the Western powers’ red line concerning chemical weapons use.

Opinion: Syria resolution shows West's weakness
Agreeing to a UN resolution to destroy Syria's chemical weapons is an important step forward for UN diplomacy. However, it also reflects an overall lack of assertiveness on the West's behalf, says DW's Loay Mudhoon.
DW's Loay Mudhoon
At last it's been lifted - the two-and-a-half-year embargo at the UN Security Council, preventing every form of internationally coordinated action regarding the conflict in Syria. After weeks of discussion and negotiations between Russian and American diplomats, the UN's most powerful body has adopted an internationally binding resolution that compels Syria to destroy all of its chemical weapons.
It appears that the Obama administration in particular is pleased with this new resolution. US diplomats showed signs of relief that the military attack against Syria is no longer necessary - a risky maneuver, highly unpopular back at home. But they are trying also to suggest to the international community that the world's only remaining superpower remains determined to use full force against Syria's dictator, Bashar al-Assad, should he not fully comply with the demands of the UN Security Council.
Mere wishful thinking
It's without a doubt that entering a multilateral peace process could - at its best - mark a turning point in the continuous efforts to mitigate the complex Syrian crisis. But upon closer scrutiny, the American confidence in this matter is likely to turn out as mere wishful thinking. After all, they had to meet the Russians more than half way to have them abandon their irresponsible line of vetoes within the Security Council.
This, too, is the reason that the current resolution does not contain any mechanism that would allow sanctions according to chapter seven of the UN Charter - ranging from economic sanctions to military action. Considering the lessons leant from dealing with the Assad regime over the past two years, this US concession to the Russians may turn out to be an act of negligence. As a reminder: Even the dedicated, modest and experienced UN special envoy Kofi Anan fell victim to the Assad regime one year ago - a regime that knows how to double-cross the international community like no other player in the Middle East.
"Red line doctrine" watered down
More reckless still and likely more consequential is the pass the US administration gave on a clear and unambiguous condemnation of the Assad regime for its use of chemical weapons. And there's little doubt on the regime's use of such weapons given UN reports. It appears a reminder is necessary that the use of internationally outlawed chemical warfare against civilians clearly crosses the red line as previously defined by US President Obama.
The dangerous watering down of this self-defined "red-line-doctrine" reveals the lack of assertiveness within the Obama administration, which could well have devastating results for the credibility of the West as a whole.
What the current resolution lacks is a roadmap towards a ceasefire in the country, and so far it remains unclear how the numerous conflict parties in Syria and their regional sponsors will react to this resolution. This leaves the US with no other choice but to hope for the active cooperation of regional stakeholders such as Iran and Saudi Arabia. What's clear is that the West will not be able to act alone to stop the destructive momentum Syria's civil war has gained.

Syria's foreign minister says Assad stays despite UN threats
Syria's foreign minister has said the government won’t accept any peace plan that excludes President Bashar al-Assad. On Friday, the UN Security Council unanimously voted to destroy the regime's chemical weapons.

Syrians react to UN decision
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem made the statement Saturday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. Friday's Security Council resolution had also endorsed the outcome of a June 2012 conference in Geneva between the regime and the opposition, which called for the establishment of a transitional government with full executive powers. The Syrian opposition, embroiled in the bloody conflict with Assad's forces for two and a half years, has repeatedly refused to take part in any transition government that includes the president.
"For the Syrian people, Bashar Assad is the elected president until mid-2014, when presidential elections will be held," al-Moallem said. He added that anyone could run for the post.
The Council's decision Friday came after the authority tasked with implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention - the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - had approved the plan. According to the resolution, the UN will work to assist the OPCW in its effort to eliminate all of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons by mid-2014. The 15-member council agreed that non-compliance would prompt a vote on punitive action by passing another resolution under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, including sanctions or military strikes.
"The Security Council has shown that when we put aside politics for the common good, we are still capable of doing big things," US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday. "We must work together with the same determination, the same cooperation that has brought us here tonight, in order to end the conflict that continues to tear Syria apart," he added.
'First hopeful news'
The UN announced Friday that inspectors currently in Syria would investigate seven sites of alleged chemical attacks, four more than previously known. That announcement had come hours before the UN Security Council voted unanimously to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. The team initially visited Syria last month to investigate three alleged chemical attacks this year, but, just days into the visit, on August 21, a chemical strike hit the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Ghouta, and the inspectors turned their attention to that case.
The inquiry did not assess who committed the attack, but concluded that whoever did had used the nerve agent sarin. According to the United States, more than 1,400 people died in the attack.
On Friday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on both Assad and the opposition to cooperate in the dismantling of the chemical weapons arsenal. He also called on the Syrian government and Syrian opposition to meet in Geneva in mid-November for peace talks.
"Today's historic resolution is the first hopeful news on Syria in a long time," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the Council late on Friday. "All sides share a common interest in the permanent destruction of these weapons," Ban added.
Fighting in Syria has claimed more than 100,000 lives since the revolution began as a series of peaceful protests against the government in March 2011. The conflict has also driven some 2 million refugees into neighboring countries, according to UN estimates.

Hague hails UN Syria weapons vote
William Hague has welcomed a "ground-breaking" United Nations resolution  to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons, but called for greater efforts to end the suffering of its people.
Sat, September 28, 2013

The Foreign Secretary said the unanimous UN Security Council resolution was about "ensuring" that the horrors of the Assad regime's chemical attacks never happened again.
He claimed the focus was now on "the everyday horrors of the dire humanitarian situation" in Syria ahead of a new round of diplomatic discussions regarding Syria in Geneva in mid-November.
And he announced that Britain had pledged a three million-dollar (£1.8m) contribution to the intergovernmental body which works to ban chemical weapons.
Following the vote, Mr Hague said: " Let us not forget that council action today has come only after two and a half years of unchecked brutality and well over 100,000 dead and millions displaced.
"The failure of the council to tackle the crimes committed on a daily basis has resulted in a culture of impunity in which a brutal regime believed it could get away with murdering its own men, women and children.
"So it is vital that the council now builds on the consensus we have reached today to make progress today towards a sustainable resolution of the crisis.
"With renewed purpose and resolve, we need to achieve a political transition."
The unanimous resolution came after Russia and China had previously vetoed three Western-backed attempts to pressure President Bashar Assad into ending the violence.
Mr Hague said it imposed " legally binding and enforceable obligations on the Syrian regime".
In order to ensure the identification and removal of chemical weapons, he said Britain would give£1.8 million to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons and urged other countries to do the same.
US secretary of state John Kerry said the  destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile would begin in November and be completed by the middle of next year.
The permanent members of the security council also endorsed for the first time a road map for a political transition in Syria put forward in June 2012.
They declared their aim to a hold negotiations in Geneva in mid-November after the US and Russia achieved a deal there to tackle the issue of Assad's chemical weapons stockpile earlier this month.
Regarding the second meeting in Geneva, Mr Hague said: "The goal is something on which we all agree - a negotiated transition in Syria, starting with the formation of a transitional governing body with full executive powers formed on the basis of mutual consent."
Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell, a member of the Commons Foreign Affairs committee, said: "Amidst the euphoria at the UN in New York one significant issue remains unresolved.
"Is it now universally accepted, as all the evidence points to, that the Assad regime used chemical weapons against its own citizens?
"Is there a proper determination to bring to justice those who committed a war crime by using these weapons as the Secretary General of the UN has said?
"It would be quite wrong and contrary to principle if the result of the rapprochement over Syria between the USA and Russia were to wipe a very dirty slate clean."
Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said: "The fact that the Security Council can reach an agreement  on Syria's chemical weapons is very welcome, but chemical weapons are not killing and injuring most  children. We now need action by the UN Security Council to get aid to children cut off in Syria.
"If something as  sensitive and complex as allowing access for chemical weapons inspectors can be achieved, then surely  the basic need for humanitarian aid access can be unanimously supported.
"The children of Syria can't wait another two-and-a-half years for an agreement on the kind of  assistance that can save their lives.
"With winter just around the corner, now more than ever, children  need food, medicine and shelter. This must be the world's number one priority for Syria."

Russian President Vladimir Putin. Better than Obama on Syria, war-weary Americans agree.  (Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife)
Maybe you can blame George W. Bush for this one.  Apparently Americans have grown tired of wars in the Middle East and trust Russian president Vladimir Putin to lead on this issue much more than they do the POTUS himself, Barack Obama.
A poll by YouGov released this week asked respondents “which leader was most effective during the Syrian chemical weapons crisis?”  Answer: Putin 49%. Obama: 25%.  Other world leaders are not even close.  The third place finisher is U.K.’s David Cameron at 6%. The U.K. Parliament quickly squashed any notion of going into Syria with the U.S.  Cameron will not play the part of Tony Blair to Obama’s Bush.
When the question was asked in reverse — “which leader was the least effect” — Obama was the winner with 44% saying he was indeed the worst leader on the Syria chemical weapons matter.
On Aug. 22, an unknown group fired rockets into residential neighborhoods around Damascus in Syria, injuring hundreds.  The U.S. government immediately blamed the military of Syrian president Bashar Assad. Russia countered and said, “not so fast”.  Putin didn’t blame anyone, but said it was more than likely a provocation designed to rope Washington into another Middle Eastern war.
Obama didn’t care and neither did his Secretary of State, John Kerry. They were certain it was Assad.  Obama quickly ordered the military to be prepared for torpedo strikes fired from American destroyers off shore.  But when world opinion turned on the President, and Washington’s biggest war-hawk allies in the U.K. balked on the idea of more Middle East entanglements, Obama back-peddled and handed the military intervention decision over to Congress.
Congress has yet to vote on the matter.
Then Putin stepped in this month with a plan to get Syria to remove its chemical weapons arsenal and sign the U.N. Convention on Chemical Weapons. Assad signed it on Sept. 14 and is currently working on destroying its chemical weaponry.
Many American pundits called Obama weak for siding with Putin.
Moreover, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council agreed Thursday on a resolution that requires Syria to give up its chemical weapons — as Putin requested among loudly beating war drums —  but added that there will be no penalties if Syria did not comply. Kerry almost looks despondent in this Associated Press photo published today in The New York Times.
Americans have clearly sided with Putin, too, and not Obama. The anti-war majority won’t find any representative voice in the media.  Over the last two weeks, pundits said Obama was weak for agreeing to the Putin plan.
All of this U.N. Security Council resolution news makes one wonder: the U.S. is back to dealing with the debt ceiling again, back to quantitative easing, back to wars or rumors of wars in the Middle East, and we are even back to trying to defund ObamaCare.  Are there any pundits out there who can explain how the country has moved forward over the last eight years?
The President’s overall approval rating remains low at 38%, just above the all-time low approval rating of 36% recorded in mid-2011 by YouGov pollsters.  Some 55% disapprove of Obama job in office, according to YouGov.
Thanks to civil unrest in Syria, Damascus has become one of the worst cities in the world, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit.

APNewsBreak: Chemical weapons watchdog wants Syria inspections by  Oct. 1
Published September 27, 2013
Associated Press
THE HAGUE, Netherlands –  The global chemical weapons watchdog will discuss Friday a disarmament plan for Syria that calls for inspections of the civil war-torn country's chemical arsenal to begin by Tuesday.
The draft decision of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) obtained by The Associated Press also authorizes the body to inspect "any other site identified by a State Party as having been involved in the Syrian chemical weapons program, unless deemed unwarranted by the Director-General."
That goes beyond usual practice as the organization has only previously inspected sites that have been declared by member states.
The draft, being discussed by the OPCW's executive council Friday night, calls for the organization's secretariat to, "as soon as possible and no later than 1 October 2013, initiate inspections in the Syrian Arab Republic." And it lays out the target of destroying all of Syria's chemical weapons and equipment by "the first half of 2014."
The draft comes a day after the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council agreed on the text of a resolution that demands that Syria abandon its chemical stockpile and allow unfettered access to chemical weapons experts. But if Syria fails to comply, the council will need to adopt a second resolution to impose measures under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows for military and nonmilitary actions to promote peace and security.
The combined OPCW and Security Council action represents a significant breakthrough and rare unity between Russia, which has supported Syrian President Bashar Assad's government, and the United States.
If the OPCW executive council approves the draft decision later, the Security Council could vote late Friday at the earliest on its resolution.
The OPCW plan says the organization should consider reporting any delay or lack of cooperation by Syria to the Security Council. The draft decision also sets out a clear and ambitious timeline for the verification and destruction of Syria's weapons and production facilities.
According to the plan, Damascus must, within a week of the decision being approved, provide more detailed information on its arsenal including the name and quantity of all chemicals in its weapons stockpile including precursor chemicals; the type of and quantity of munitions that can be used to fire chemical weapons; the location of the weapons, storage facilities and production facilities. And the destruction of all chemical weapons production and mixing or filling equipment has to be completed no later than Nov. 1.
The decision calls on Syria to "cooperate fully with all aspects of the implementation of this decision, including by providing the OPCW personnel with the immediate and unfettered right to inspect any and all sites in the Syrian Arab Republic."
The recent flurry of diplomatic activity was triggered by the Aug. 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb, and President Barack Obama's subsequent threat to use military force.
When U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Assad could avert U.S. military action by turning over "every single bit of his chemical weapons" to international control within a week, Russia quickly agreed. Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signed an agreement in Geneva on Sept. 13 to put Syria's chemical weapons under international control for later destruction, and Assad's government accepted and quickly signed up to Chemical Weapons Convention that is policed by the Hague-based OPCW.

China welcomes UN Syria chemical arms resolution
Published September 28, 2013
AFP
China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi speaks to the media after the UN Security Council voted to approve a resolution that will require Syria to give up its chemical weapons, on September 27, 2013 at the UN headquarters in New YorkAFP
Beijing (AFP) –  China welcomed a United Nations resolution aimed at destroying Syria's chemical arms, and urged the major powers to ensure their decisions "can stand the test of history", state media reported Saturday.
Beijing was "heartened" to see the landmark UN Security Council resolution on Friday which ordered the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons and condemned a murderous poison gas attack in Damascus, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.
"In dealing with the Syrian issue, the Security Council must bear in mind the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, act with a sense of responsibility to the Syrian people, the world and history, and ensure that any decision it takes can stand the test of history," he told the council after the vote, Xinhua reported.
"We hope that the relevant parties will stay in close cooperation, fulfil their respective responsibilities... (to) achieve a proper settlement of the issue of chemical weapons in Syria," Wang added.
The UN Security Council  -- of which China is a member -- overcame a prolonged deadlock to approve the first council resolution on the conflict, which is now 30 months old with more than 100,000 dead.
Resolution 2118, the result of bruising negotiations between the United States and Russia, gives international binding force to a plan drawn up by the two to eliminate President Bashar al-Assad's chemical arms.
China routinely voices opposition to interference in other countries' domestic affairs and strongly opposes military action over Syria.
A statement was released on the foreign ministry's website Saturday, welcoming the resolution and offering to "send experts to participate in the work and to provide funds".

UN Security Council votes to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons
Published September 28, 2013
Associated Press
Sept. 27, 2013: The United Nations Security Council votes on a resolution that will require Syria to give up its chemical weapons at U.N. Headquarters.AP
UNITED NATIONS –  The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Friday night to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, a landmark decision aimed at taking poison gas off the battlefield in the escalating 2 1/2-year conflict.
The vote after two weeks of intense negotiations marked a major breakthrough in the paralysis that has gripped the council since the Syrian uprising began. Russia and China previously vetoed three Western-backed resolutions pressuring President Bashar Assad's regime to end the violence.
"Today's historic resolution is the first hopeful news on Syria in a long time," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the council immediately after the vote, but he and others stressed that much more needs to be done to stop the fighting that has left more 100,000 dead.
"A red light for one form of weapons does not mean a green light for others," the U.N. chief said. "This is not a license to kill with conventional weapons."
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the "strong, enforceable, precedent-setting" resolution shows that diplomacy can be so powerful "that it can peacefully defuse the worst weapons of war."
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stressed that the resolution does not automatically impose sanctions on Syria. The resolution calls for consequences if Syria fails to comply, but those will depend on the council passing another resolution in the event of non-compliance. That will give Assad ally Russia the means to stop any punishment from being imposed.
As a sign of the broad support for the resolution, all 15 council members signed on as co-sponsors.
For the first time, the council endorsed the roadmap for a political transition in Syria adopted by key nations in June 2012 and called for an international conference to be convened "as soon as possible" to implement it.
Ban said the target date for a new peace conference in Geneva is mid-November.
Whether the council can remain united to press for an end to the conflict remains to be seen.
"We know despite its clear usefulness, one resolution alone will not save Syria," France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said after the vote.
Syria's U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari accused unnamed nations of already giving the resolution a negative interpretation and trying to "derail it from its lofty purposes."
And Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have been harshly critical of Obama's policy on Syria, dismissed the resolution as "another triumph of hope over reality." It "contains no meaningful or immediate enforcement mechanisms, let alone a threat of the use of force for the Assad regime's non-compliance," they said in a statement that was highly skeptical that Russia would ever approve a threat of force for non-compliance.
The vote came just hours after the world's chemical weapons watchdog adopted a U.S.-Russian plan that lays out benchmarks and timelines for cataloguing, quarantining and ultimately destroying Syria's chemical weapons, their precursors and delivery systems.
The Security Council resolution enshrines the plan approved by Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, making it legally binding.
The agreement allows the start of a mission to rid Syria's regime of its estimated 1,000-ton chemical arsenal by mid-2014, significantly accelerating a destruction timetable that often takes years to complete.
Kerry said the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile will begin in November and be completed as called for by the middle of next year.
"We expect to have an advance team on the ground (in Syria) next week," OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan told reporters at the organization's headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands immediately after its 41-member executive council approved the plan.
The OPCW plan gives Damascus a week to provide detailed information on its arsenal, including the name and quantity of all chemicals in its stockpile; the type and quantity of munitions that can be used to fire chemical weapons; and the location of weapons, storage facilities and production facilities. All chemical weapons production and mixing equipment should be destroyed no later than Nov. 1.
The Security Council resolution does not assign blame for any chemical attack. Some Western countries had wanted the draft to demand that the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks be referred to the International Criminal Court to be prosecuted for war crimes. Diplomats said this was discussed, but Russia objected.
As a result, the draft says only that the Security Council "expresses its strong conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic should be held accountable."
The recent flurry of diplomatic activity followed the Aug. 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb, and by President Obama's threat of U.S. strikes in retaliation.
After Kerry said Assad could avert U.S. military action by turning over "every single bit of his chemical weapons" to international control within a week, Russia quickly agreed. Kerry and Lavrov signed an agreement in Geneva on Sept. 13 to put Syria's chemical weapons under international control for later destruction, and Assad's government accepted.
Tough negotiations, primarily between Russia and the United States, followed on how Syria's stockpile would be destroyed.
The U.N. resolution's adoption was assured when the five veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council -- Russia, China, the United States, France and Britain -- signed off on the text on Thursday.
Russia and the United States had been at odds over the enforcement issue. Russia opposed any reference to Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows for military and nonmilitary actions to promote peace and security.
The final resolution states that the Security Council will impose measures under Chapter 7 if Syria fails to comply, but this would require adoption of a second resolution.
It bans Syria from possessing chemical weapons and condemns "in the strongest terms" the use of chemical weapons in the Aug. 21 attack, and any other use. It also would ban any country from obtaining chemical weapons or the technology or equipment to produce them from Syria.
Kerry stressed that the resolution for the first time makes a determination that "use of chemical weapons anywhere constitutes a threat to international peace and security," which sets a new international norm.
The resolution authorizes the U.N. to send an advance team to assist the OPCW's activities in Syria. It asks Secretary-General Ban to submit recommendations to the Security Council within 10 days of the resolution's adoption on the U.N. role in eliminating Syria's chemical weapons program.
"Syria cannot select or reject the inspectors," Kerry said. "Syria must give those inspectors unfettered access to any and all sites and any and all people."
The resolution requires the council to review compliance with the OPCW's plans within 30 days, and every month after that.
In an indication of the enormity of the task ahead, the OPCW appealed for donations to fund the disarmament, saying it will have to hire new weapons inspectors and chemical experts.
To that end, Britain's foreign minister announced after Friday's vote that the UK would donate $3 million to OPCW Syria Trust fund.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the Security Council that China was also prepared to help fund the disarmament mission.
Meanwhile, a group of U.N. inspectors already in Syria investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons said Friday they are probing a total of seven suspected attacks, including in the Damascus suburb where hundreds were killed last month. That number was raised from three sites previously.
The OPCW destruction plan calls on Syria to give inspectors unfettered access to any site suspected of chemical weapons involvement, even if Syria's government did not identify the location. That gives the inspectors unusually broad authority.

UN Syria resolution 'fails to ensure justice': HRW
Published September 28, 2013
AFP
British Foreign Minister William Hague (L) speaks in the UN Security Council just after it voted to approve a resolution that will require Syria to give up its chemical weapons, on September 27, 2013 at the UN headquarters in New YorkAFP
Beirut (AFP) –  Human Rights Watch on Saturday criticised a hard-won UN Security Council resolution ordering the destruction of Syria's chemical arsenal for failing to deliver justice for the conflict's victims.
"This resolution fails to ensure justice for the gassing of hundreds of children and many other grave crimes," said the New York-based watchdog's United Nations director, Philippe Bolopion.
Bolopion renewed HRW's longstanding call for the UN to "refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC), and adopt targeted sanctions against those responsible for mass killings."
Britain and France had pressed for Friday's resolution to refer August 21 gas attacks in the Damascus suburbs to the ICC in The Hague.
But their calls were rebuffed by Damascus ally Moscow, which had vetoed three previous draft resolutions on the Syrian conflict since it erupted two and a half years ago.
Instead the resolution expressed "strong conviction" that those responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria "should be held accountable."
HRW said it was vital that the world not lose sight of the fact that the great majority of deaths in the Syrian conflict were the result of conventional and not chemical weapons.
"Efforts to destroy Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons are essential, but do not address the reality that conventional weapons have killed the overwhelming majority of the estimated 100,000 people who have died in the conflict," Bolopion said.
"If the killing of civilians by conventional weapons continues unabated, the chemical weapons resolution will be remembered as an effort to draw red lines, not save civilian lives."
HRW said Syrian government troops have used a host of other banned weapons in the conflict, such as cluster bombs and landmines.
They must also "stop using air-dropped incendiary weapons in populated areas", the group said.
Similar concerns were expressed by UN chief Ban Ki-moon, who insisted the resolution was not "a licence to kill" with conventional arms.
"All violence must end. All the guns must fall silent," Ban said.
"A red light for one form of weapons does not mean a green light for others."

New Syrian inspection by UN chemical experts

Damascus (AFP) –  UN chemical weapons experts, in Syria to investigate alleged use of the banned arms, on Sunday left their Damascus hotel to carry out a new mission, an AFP photographer said.
The experts, who arrived in the Syrian capital last Wednesday on their second visit in two months, headed out on board four UN vehicles.
The United Nations has said the experts are investigating seven alleged chemical weapons attacks and expect to wind up their work on the ground on Monday.
They hope to have a comprehensive report ready "by late October".
The UN mission is separate from a team of Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspectors due to start work in the coming days to destroy Syria's chemical arsenal.
The alleged attacks being probed include a March 19 incident in Khan al-Assal, in Aleppo province of northern Syria, that both the regime and rebels reported, each accusing the other of responsibility.
Other sites being investigated include the Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood of Aleppo city, allegedly the site of an April attack, and Saraqeb in the northwest province of Idlib on the border with Turkey.
The team is also continuing investigations into an August 21 attack in the suburbs of Damascus that coincided with their first mission to Syria last month.
The UN experts visited the site of that alleged attack during their first trip and have issued a preliminary report confirming the use of the nerve agent sarin in the area.
In addition, the team is investigating three subsequent alleged attacks -- on August 22 in Bahhariyeh, near Damascus, on August 24 in the Jubar district of the capital, and a seventh incident reported in Ashrafiyeh Sahnaya, Damascus province, on August 25.
"In the course of performing their task, the experts have received several documents and samples and have conducted many interviews," the UN said in a statement.
The UN team's first report, issued on September 16, said there was evidence that sarin had been used in the August 21 attack.
But the experts are mandated only to investigate whether chemical weapons were used, not to determine who was responsible for their use.
Both the Syrian regime and the rebels seeking its overthrow have repeatedly accused each other of using chemical weapons.
But in the wake of the August 21 attack, which allegedly left hundreds dead, the United States threatened military action against the Syrian regime, which it accuses of responsibility.
The regime denies involvement but agreed soon afterwards to relinquish its chemical arsenal under a US-Russian deal, which was enshrined in a landmark UN Security Council resolution on Friday.

Opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reacted with disappointment yesterday at the passing of a resolution by the UN Security Council, arguing that the move will do little to bring those responsible for chemical attacks to justice.
“These weapons were used against the Syrian people and the perpetrator must be punished for this,” said Riad Nassan Agha, a former Syrian culture minister.
“The resolution faintly refers to accountability and does not call for a trial. The resolution seems to have lent UN legitimisation to the killing of Syrians by all arms other than the chemical and nuclear weapons,” he said, according to the independent website all4syria.
On Friday, the Security Council unanimously adopted a binding resolution ordering the expeditious destruction of Syria’s chemical arsenal.
The council also threatened punitive measures against any Syrian parties that fail to comply with the timetable for the verification and destruction of the weapons.
The US and Russia hailed the adoption of the resolution as a successful diplomatic effort to fight the use of the weapons.
But according to Radwan Ziadeh, a Syrian opposition figure living in Istanbul, the resolution is “disappointing for Syrians”.
“It does not provide a clear mechanism to bring to justice the criminals in the regime who are responsible for the use of chemical weapons against civilians in Eastern Ghouta,” he told DPA.
Ziadeh was referring to an August 21 toxic attack near the Syrian capital Damascus, which according to the US killed more than 1,400 people.
Washington has blamed Assad’s regime for the attack, a claim denied by the Syrian government.
The European Union praised the UN resolution as a major step towards resolving Syria’s 30-month crisis.
“This decision should pave the way to the elimination of chemical weapons in Syria, and set a standard for the international community in responding to threats posed by weapons of mass destruction,” the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, said in Brussels.
“We must not lose sight of the most important goal: ending the violence and heading towards a peaceful and democratic transition in Syria.”
The UN resolution was adopted shortly after the executive committee of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) adopted plans for the destruction of the weapons.
The first OPCW representatives are to travel to Damascus on Monday and weapons inspection will follow immediately.
UN inspectors already in Syria are currently investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons in seven places, including three where the banned weapons are suspected to have been unleashed after the August 21 attack.
The UN expects to complete its investigation by tomorrow and present a “comprehensive report” by late October.
In Syria, clashes have erupted between insurgents with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, an Al Qaeda-linked group, and Kurdish fighters, reported an activist watchdog.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights added that both sides suffered unspecified casualties in the fighting in the northern province of Aleppo

Resolution at last over chemical weapons
Sunday 29 September 2013
THE UN Security Council has unanimously voted to adopt a binding resolution on ridding Syria of chemical weapons, ending two years of deadlock on how to deal with the country's civil war.

UN vote hailed, but lack of punishment element questioned By Judith Duffy and John Irish
A draft document agreed by Russia and the US was backed by the 15-member body at a session on New York. It demands the eradication of Syria's chemical weapons but does not threaten automatic punitive action against Syria's government if it does not comply.
Loading article content
The unanimous vote, after two weeks of negotiations, marked a major breakthrough in the paralysis that has gripped the council since the Syrian uprising began. Russia, backed by China, has vetoed three Western-backed resolutions since October 2011 pressuring Assad's regime to end the violence.
A new round of international diplomatic discussions regarding Syria is now also expected to take place in mid-November in Geneva.
Speaking immediately after the vote in New York on Friday, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon told the council: "Today's historic resolution is the first hopeful news on Syria in a long time."
But he stressed that eliminating chemical weapons from the Syrian conflict "is not a licence to kill with conventional weapons".
US Secretary of State John Kerry said the "strong, enforceable, ­precedent-setting" resolution showed that diplomacy can be so powerful "that it can peacefully defuse the worst weapons of war".
Kerry added that the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile would begin in November.
US President Barack Obama had earlier called the draft UN resolution a "potentially huge victory for the international community".
Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed the resolution, but also called for greater efforts to end the suffering of its people. He announced that Britain had pledged a £1.8 million contribution to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the intergovernmental body which works to ban chemical weapons.
"We expect to have an advance team on the ground [in Syria] next week," OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan said at its headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands.
Following the UN vote, Hague said: "Let us not forget that council action today has come only after two-and-a-half years of unchecked brutality and well over 100,000 dead and millions displaced.
"The failure of the council to tackle the crimes committed on a daily basis has resulted in a culture of impunity in which a brutal regime believed it could get away with murdering its own men, women and children. So it is vital that the council now builds on the consensus we have reached today to make progress today towards a sustainable resolution of the crisis."
The resolution calls for consequences if Syria fails to comply, but those will depend on the council passing another resolution in the event of non-compliance. That will give Russia the means to stop any punishment from being imposed.
The recent flurry of diplomatic activity followed the August 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians in Damascus and led to Obama's threatening US strikes against Syria in retaliation.
Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell, a member of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said: "Amidst the euphoria at the UN in New York one significant issue remains unresolved. Is it now accepted, as all the evidence points to, that the Assad regime used chemical weapons against its own citizens?
"Is there a proper determination to bring to justice those who committed a war crime by using these weapons, as the secretary-general of the UN has said? It would be quite wrong and contrary to principle if the result of the rapprochement over Syria between the US and Russia were to wipe a very dirty slate clean."

NSEL fiasco: Probe indicates money laundering violations
In a major breakthrough, the UN Security Council Friday voted unanimously on a resolution to destroy Syria's chemicals weapons stockpile and warned of strong actions in case of non-compliance by Damascus.
Ending a dramatic month of diplomacy, the 15-nation UNSC voted unanimously on the resolution which was based on a deal struck between Russia and the US following last month's chemical weapons attack on a Damascus suburb.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called the passing of the resolution the "first hopeful news" on Syria in a long time and said he hopes to convene a peace conference in mid-November to end the ongoing civil war in the Arab country. "It is time for the parties to focus on how to build the peaceful, democratic future Syria needs," he said.
The UNSC called for the speedy implementation of procedures drawn up by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons "for the expeditious destruction of the Syrian Arab Republic's chemical weapons programme and stringent verification thereof."
In the text, the Council underscored "that no party in Syria should use, develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, retain, or transfer chemical weapons."
Defiance of the resolution would bring about measures which can include sanctions or stronger coercive action, the Council said.
Kerry warns Syria over UN resolution
US Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that Syria would face punishment if it does not comply with the UNSC resolution on its chemical weapons. "Should the regime fail to act, there will be consequences," Kerry told the UNSC after the vote sealing a US-Russian agreement. PTI

Syrian Chemical Weapons Deal: What Follows?

Syrian Chemical Weapons Deal: What Follows?
by Stephen Lendman
It's all over but the beginning. More on that below.
On Friday, Security Council members unanimously adopted Resolution 2118: Security Council Requires Scheduled Destruction of Syria's Chemical Weapons.
Ir rules out military force. It's "fully consistent with the Russian-US Geneva agreements," said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
"This is the result of coordinated efforts of Russia and the United States backed by all members of the UN Security Council and the majority of other states."
"The resolution does not fall under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter and does not authorize the automatic use of measures of compulsion."
"It reaffirms the agreement reached at the Russian-US meeting in Geneva to make a breach of its provisions and the use of chemical weapons by any side a subject of thorough investigation at the UN Security Council, which will be prepared to act under Chapter 7 of the Charter."
Naturally, (it will act) proportionately to the severity of violations, which must be proven to be 100% true," Lavrov stressed.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is in charge of destroying Syria's stockpile.
According to Lavrov:
"We firmly believe that OPCW and UN experts on Syria mission will be professional and unbiased and fully respect the sovereignty of that country."
"Everything must be done to put Syrian chemical arsenals under control in line with the OPCW Executive Council's decision in an efficient way and within a period sufficient for observing all the safety norms."
"The Syrian government is not the only side responsible for the fulfillment of this resolution."
"The Security Council demands that the Syrian opposition also must cooperate with international experts."
"Therefore, the reports to be submitted to the Security Council during the implementation of the OPCW decision and the newly adopted resolution must be objective and present the situation applicably to all sides of the Syrian conflict."
"Those who support and sponsor the opposition bear the special responsibility. They must prevent extremists from coming into possession of chemical weapons," Lavrov stressed.
"Syria has begun to fulfill its commitments with the submission of a detailed declaration of the status of its chemical arsenal to the OPCW. We expect Damascus to continue its conscientious and constructive interaction with the international inspectors."
"Hopefully, the increasingly disconnected units of the Syrian opposition will finally announce their readiness to participate in the international conference without preconditions, like the Syrian government did a long time ago."
"Russia is ready to participate in the forthcoming operation in Syria in all its components," Lavrov said.
Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow will be involved in destroying and/or transporting Syria's CWs if called on to do so.
Syria's obligated to destroy its production facilities by November 1. It must eliminate its CWs by mid-2014. No specific date is mandated.
OPCW's governing council is fully in charge. Syria must give its personnel "immediate and unfettered right to inspect any and all sites."
An accelerated timetable is planned. On Friday, OPCW officials agreed on what follows.
On October 1, its inspectors will arrive in Syria. They'll examine its CWs, delivery systems and production facilities.
According to OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu:
"This decision sends an unmistakable message that the international community is coming together to work for peace in Syria beginning with the elimination of chemical weapons in that country."
Syria's UN envoy Bashar al-Jaafair said Resolution 2118 includes most of his government's concerns.
Damascus is fully committed to comply, he said. At the same time, he expressed concern about "some delegations adopting a negative interpretation of the resolution in order to derail it from its lofty purposes."
America, Britain, France, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar must commit to its provisions, he stressed. They must stop arming insurgents. They must be held accountable if they continue to do so.
"You can't bring terrorists from all over the world and send them into Syria in the name of jihad and then pretend that you are working for peace," he added.
Plans are for a mid-November Geneva II peace conference. Syria agreed to participate. It'll do so with no preconditions. It remains to be seen how opposition elements react.
On September 19, Syrian National Coalition (SNC) president Ahmad Jarba said he'll participate if "all parties agree that the purpose of the conference will be the establishment of a transitional government with full executive powers."
Weeks earlier he refused to do so unless Assad agreed to step down. On September 27, he said he's prepared to participate conditionally.
He wants assurances of a "clear timetable" for achieving results. He's against an "open-ended dialogue" with Syria's government.
He wants Assad allied foreign groups excluded. He alluded to Iran and Hezbollah. He said nothing non-Syrian anti-Assad insurgents involved in daily fighting.
About a dozen "rebel" groups broke ranks with SNC. Infighting's gone on for months. Competing factions are their own worst enemies.
Internecine fighting continues. Disputes aren't just over weapons and tactics. They reflect a desire to usurp power. Extremist elements want religious rule imposed.
They comprise the vast majority of fighters. Assad believes they constitute from 80 - 90%. His front line forces are in the best position to know.
Whatever Geneva II achieves won't stop Al Qaeda, Al Nusra and other extremist elements from continuing to fight. Stopping them depends on refusing to supply more arms, munitions, funding, training and direction.
Washington calls the shots. Other anti-Assad countries go along. On the one hand, Obama and Kerry urge diplomatic conflict resolution.
On the other, they continue waging war. They're using proxy death squads. They have no plans to stop. They want Assad ousted. They want pro-Western puppet governance replacing him.
Geneva I (June 2012) agreed on lofty guidelines and principles. They included "a political transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people."
Efforts going forward require "facilitat(ing) a Syrian-led political process" representing all its citizens.
Transitional government must be "genuinely democratic and pluralistic."
Syrians alone must "determine the future of the country."
"The sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Syria must be respected."
Conflict resolution must be achieved through peaceful dialogue and negotiation. Force was ruled out.
Washington ignored Geneva provisions. It systematically violated them repeatedly. It still does so.
Whatever Geneva II achieves won't matter. Obama wants Assad toppled. War is his bottom line option to do so. He didn't launch it to quit.
Escalating it is delayed. It's not deterred. America's addicted to war. Obama believes war is peace.
The business of America is war. One segues into another. They rage without end. They do so while homeland needs go begging.
They do it to advance America's imperium. At issue is eliminating all independent sovereign governments. Washington wants puppet ones replacing them. It wants unchallenged global dominance.
Waging war lets racketeering profiteers gorge themselves at the public trough. Millions of lost lives don't matter.
Profits and power alone count. Pursuing them involves ravaging and destroying one country after another.
Eisenhower warned about the "potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power. (It) exists and will persist," he said.
Imagine what he'd say about today's fortress America. Imagine his reaction to America waging one war after another. Imagine his horror about unconscionable amounts spent.
Imagine his reaction to global wars. Imagine his condemnation of out-of-control imperialism. Imagine how he'd address possible mass annihilation.
Imagine his outrage about America heading for tyranny and ruin. Hannah Arendt addressed it decades earlier. She did so in her book titled "The Origins of Totalitarianism."
She said tyrants are "never content to rule by external means, namely, through the state and a machinery of violence; thanks to its peculiar ideology and the role assigned to it in this apparatus of coercion, totalitarianism (and) a means of dominating and terrorizing human beings from within."
She called it dictatorship based on:
"(1) an elaborate ideology;
(2) a single mass party;
(3) terror;
(4) a technologically conditioned monopoly of communication;
(5) a monopoly of weapons; (and)
(6) a centrally controlled economy."
These characteristics reflect today's America. Wealth, power, privilege and dominance alone matter.
Duopoly power runs things. Monied interests control it. State terrorism is official policy. Waging war on humanity reflects it.
Media scoundrels march in lockstep. They support unconscionable policies. They regurgitate Big Lies. They do it consistently. They facilitate mass slaughter, destruction and homeland police state harshness.
Banks and other corporate favorites run things. They decide policy. US-style democracy is the best money can buy.
Genocidal wars are waged for profit and power. Afghanistan is America's longest conflict. It shows no signs of ending. It could persist for another decade or longer.
America's legacy in Iraq and Libya is anarchy, horrendous daily violence, poverty, unemployment, disease, hunger, homelessness, deprivation and human misery.
Syrians suffer the same way. The worst may be yet to come. Make no mistake. Obama wants full-scale war. He intends to get it.
It's as simple as another false flag Big Lie. UN resolutions and peace conferences don't matter.
Cruise missile diplomacy is official US policy. Bombs away could happen any time. Stopping Obama's rage to war matters most.
Never in human history was a global peace offensive more needed. Humanity's survival depends on it.

UN chemical experts on new Syria inspection
September 29 2013 at 12:19pm
By SAPA
Comment on this story
Reuters.
Members of a United Nations (UN) chemical weapons investigation team sit in a UN vehicle before leaving a hotel where the team is staying, in Damascus September 28, 2013. The UN Security Council adopted a resolution on Friday that demands the eradication of Syria's chemical weapons but does not threaten automatic punitive action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government if it does not comply.

SA welcomes Syria decision
Damascus - UN chemical weapons experts, in Syria to investigate alleged use of the banned arms, on Sunday left their Damascus hotel to carry out a new mission, an AFP photographer said.
The experts, who arrived in the Syrian capital last Wednesday on their second visit in two months, headed out on board four UN vehicles.
The United Nations has said the experts are investigating seven alleged chemical weapons attacks and expect to wind up their work on the ground on Monday.
They hope to have a comprehensive report ready “by late October”.
The UN mission is separate from a team of Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspectors due to start work in the coming days to destroy Syria's chemical arsenal.
The alleged attacks being probed include a March 19 incident in Khan al-Assal, in Aleppo province of northern Syria, that both the regime and rebels reported, each accusing the other of responsibility.
Other sites being investigated include the Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood of Aleppo city, allegedly the site of an April attack, and Saraqeb in the northwest province of Idlib on the border with Turkey.
The team is also continuing investigations into an August 21 attack in the suburbs of Damascus that coincided with their first mission to Syria last month.
The UN experts visited the site of that alleged attack during their first trip and have issued a preliminary report confirming the use of the nerve agent sarin in the area.
In addition, the team is investigating three subsequent alleged attacks - on August 22 in Bahhariyeh, near Damascus, on August 24
in the Jubar district of the capital, and a seventh incident reported in Ashrafiyeh Sahnaya, Damascus province, on August 25.
“In the course of performing their task, the experts have received several documents and samples and have conducted many interviews,” the UN said in a statement.
The UN team's first report, issued on September 16, said there was evidence that sarin had been used in the August 21 attack.
But the experts are mandated only to investigate whether chemical weapons were used, not to determine who was responsible for their use.
Both the Syrian regime and the rebels seeking its overthrow have repeatedly accused each other of using chemical weapons.
But in the wake of the August 21 attack, which allegedly left hundreds dead, the United States threatened military action against the Syrian regime, which it accuses of responsibility.
The regime denies involvement but agreed soon afterwards to relinquish its chemical arsenal under a US-Russian deal, which was enshrined in a landmark UN Security Council resolution on Friday. - Sapa-AFP

UNITED NATIONS — The Obama administration leaves the U.N. General Assembly this week with progress on two fronts of the Syrian conflict – a binding deal to seize chemical weapons and revived talk of a peace summit – though both developments come with serious caveats and won’t bring an end to hostilities anytime soon.
More News
Read more World News
The U.N. Security Council late Friday approved a U.S.-Russian resolution that mandates the expedited removal of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s chemical weapons arsenal but stops short of threatening military action for noncompliance. Separately, Syrian opposition leaders signaled their willingness to participate in Geneva peace talks with officials from the Assad regime, albeit under conditions that might prove difficult to meet.
“There is no question this was a momentous (U.N. General Assembly), given two weeks ago we were at a standstill on our diplomatic efforts around Syria and would not have even thought this was possible,” said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. “Now we are on the verge of passing the first binding resolution on Syria that will set the path for eliminating chemical weapons.”
With the backing of the five permanent members of the council, the resolution broke a deadlock that’s persisted for more than two years because Russia and the United States support opposite sides of Syria’s bloody civil war. Knowing that Russia would block any resolution that triggered military action should its ally Assad fail to comply, U.S. negotiators settled for diluted wording that authorizes unspecified punitive action for violations.
In other words, if Assad is accused of another chemical attack, Russia could still use its veto power to drag out the Security Council’s determination of noncompliance, and then could block the harshest measures under the U.N. Charter’s Chapter 7. Of course, President Barack Obama already has argued that he doesn’t need Security Council approval to carry out military strikes against regime targets, though that threat of unilateral military force is much dimmer now that the U.S. has signed on to the international route.
“The worst-case scenario from the administration’s perspective would be if Assad does violate the resolution in some way and then the Russians stonewall at the Security Council. Then the administration is sort of back to square one in terms of what it does,” said Peter Spiro, who teaches international law at Temple University in Philadelphia and who testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the NATO intervention in Libya.
Still, that doesn’t mean the resolution is insignificant, Spiro and other international law experts said. It would be hard for Russia to argue against findings of noncompliance as wrong or politically motivated because the resolution is written so that any violations would be confirmed first by experts from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the world body that monitors the chemical weapons ban.
Gregory Fox, who teaches international law at Wayne State University in Michigan and has written extensively about the Security Council’s role in promoting democracy, said that the lack of an automatic trigger for military action isn’t necessarily a failing in the resolution because such automatic triggers are extremely rare. The only case he could think of was Resolution 678 against Iraq in 1990, after Saddam Hussein’s forces invaded Kuwait.
Fox said the resolution’s use of “must” and “shall” to outline what Syria is to do is consistent with a Chapter 7 resolution. He noted that sanctions as a punitive tool can work, arguing that Iran wouldn’t have made the landmark overtures seen this week at the United Nations without the toll sanctions have taken on the Islamic Republic’s economy.
Spiro noted one other strongpoint of the resolution is its passing mention of the need for “accountability” for the use of chemical weapons. That, Spiro said, could be a “really small baby step” to what one day could become a tribunal before the International Criminal Court.
To the Syrian opposition’s chagrin, the deal also would appear to protect against the risk of an abrupt regime change, which the administration wants to avoid given the lack of a viable, moderate opposition authority waiting in the wings. That gives the Assad government every incentive to comply fully with the resolution, gambling that the time and expenditure associated with the undertaking would dull the West’s political will to remove him from office.
“Assad still has an overwhelming tactical advantage,” Fox said. “He’s giving up his chemical weapons, but is not giving up his ability to fight this civil war, brutally.”
Syrian opposition leaders have criticized the U.S.-Russian deal, complaining of feeling sold out by the Obama administration’s narrowing of its strategic interests to the chemical weapons issue. More than 100,000 people have died and millions have been displaced, the opposition notes, and yet the U.S. entered into a deal with Russia that all but guarantees Assad job security for at least the next several months.
Ahmed Jarba, head of the Syrian Opposition Coalition, the opposition faction recognized by the U.S. and Britain as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people, adopted a slightly softer stance toward the resolution in remarks to reporters Friday in New York. He said the opposition would’ve preferred to have seen tougher language on consequences but that, overall, the group was “happy” with the resolution because it removes at least one tool from Assad’s vast arsenal.
However, Jarba added, there must be a parallel track to support the opposition’s fighting side, which was dealt a huge blow this week when five brigades that had been part of the U.S.-backed Supreme Military Command joined an Islamist bloc spearheaded by the al Qaida-allied Nusra Front.
Jarba said he and other leaders would reach out to the defecting groups to determine the reasons for their departure and whether the move was permanent.
Jarba said Friday that his group would be willing to meet with regime officials at a peace conference in Geneva, but that the clear goal must be a transition of power. He also added on a condition that would seem impossible to meet: the removal of all foreign fighters from Syria, not just forces from Assad allies Iran and Hezbollah, but also the jihadist fighters from within rebel ranks.
Any close observer of the conflict understands that the Islamist extremist fighters comprise the rebels’ most effective fighting force, and it is difficult to see who would expel them.

BEIRUT — Syria will cooperate fully with U.N. inspectors charged with securing and destroying the country's chemical weapons stockpile, the nation's prime minister said Saturday.
SANA, File | AP Photo FILE - In this April 29, 2013 file photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi speaks to journalists after an economic meeting, in Damascus, Syria. Syria's prime minister says Damascus will fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors charged with destroying the country's chemical weapons stockpile. Al-Halqi's comments Saturday, Sept. 28, 2013 come a day after the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to purge Syria of its chemical weapons program.

The comments from Wael al-Halqi came a day after the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to purge Syria of its chemical weapons program. The U.N. resolution, passed after two weeks of white-knuckle negotiations, marked a major breakthrough in the paralysis that has gripped the council since the Syrian uprising began in March 2011.
"This resolution is in line with Syria's approach toward joining the chemical weapons convention," al-Halqi said in an interview with Lebanon's Al Manar TV. "Syria will stand by what it promised. We will cooperate and facilitate the work of the inspectors. We have provided lists with the chemical weapons we have and they can check all our institutions."
The U.N. resolution allows the start of a mission to rid Syria's regime of its estimated 1,000-ton chemical arsenal by mid-2014. It also calls for consequences if President Bashar Assad's regime fails to comply, although those will depend on the council passing another resolution in the event of non-compliance.
The vote also enshrined a plan adopted by the world's chemical weapons watchdog that lays out benchmarks and timelines for cataloguing, quarantining and ultimately destroying Syria's chemical arms, their precursors and delivery systems.
The dizzying diplomatic developments of the past two weeks are rooted in the Aug. 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb. The U.S. blamed the Assad regime for the attack, and threatened to launch punitive missile strikes.
That set in motion a flurry of diplomatic maneuvering that led eventually to Friday's Security Council resolution.
For the first time, the council also endorsed the roadmap for a political transition in Syria adopted by key nations in June 2012, and called for an international conference to be convened "as soon as possible" to implement it. U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon has set mid-November as a target date for a new peace conference in Geneva.
Speaking to Al Manar, al-Halqi said the Syrian government is ready to "negotiate with opposition forces both inside and outside of Syria — if they're willing to." But he also questioned whether the main Western-backed opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, can bring armed groups on the ground to the negotiating table.
The Coalition's control over the myriad rebel factions fighting in Syria has always been shaky, but that fact was laid bare on Wednesday after nearly a dozen of the most powerful rebel groups formally broke with it.
Inside Syria on Saturday, rebels including members of an al-Qaida-linked group captured a military post on the border with Jordan after four days of fighting. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights activist group said 26 soldiers were killed in the battle as well as a number of rebels, including seven foreign fighters.
The post, which once served as a customs office before being turned into an army outpost years ago, is on the outskirts of the southern city of Daraa where the Syrian uprising began 2 ½ years ago. The revolt later turned into a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people.
Rebels control multiple areas along the borders with Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Lebanon as well as the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
Also Saturday, a group of U.N. inspectors left their hotel in Damascus in one vehicle to an unknown location, according to an Associated Press photographer at the scene.
The U.N. said Friday its team of weapons experts currently in Syria will investigate seven sites of alleged chemical attacks in the country, four more than previously known.
The team initially visited Syria last month to investigate three alleged chemical attacks this year. But just days into the visit, the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Ghouta was hit by a chemical strike, and the inspectors turned their attention to that case. The inquiry determined that the nerve agent sarin was used in the Aug. 21 attack, but it did not assess who was behind it.
The U.N. says the team expects to finalize its activities in the country by Monday.

WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Friday praised a deal reached at the United Nations to get rid of Syria's chemical weapons cache as "a significant step forward" for the war-torn country and “a potentially huge victory for the international community.”
Obama said he believes a proposed U.N. Security Council resolution shows that the international community is "not just gathering to talk but also is able to take concerted action on behalf of enforcing international norms and preserving everybody's security."
The newly crafted resolution calls for Syria to relinquish its chemical weapons stockpile and infrastructure to international inspectors, who will be empowered to remove, disable or destroy them. The Security Council could vote on the resolution as early as Friday night, and passage is assured because all five permanent members have signaled support.
If Syria fails to comply with the disarmament plan, the Security Council would consider follow-up measures that might include sanctions or military force.
Speaking to reporters after an Oval Office meeting with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , Obama said the resolution still leaves "a lot of work to be done."
"I think, rightly, people have been concerned about whether Syria will follow through on the commitments that have been laid forth, and I think there are legitimate concerns as to how, technically, we are going to be getting those chemical weapons out while there is still fighting going on on the ground," Obama said.

UNITED NATIONS -- Russia agreed Thursday to back a United Nations Security Council resolution that demands Syria relinquish its chemical weapons, but stops short of threatening President Bashar Assad with military force if he doesn't comply.
The Obama administration hailed it as a "breakthrough" despite its failure after nearly two weeks to persuade Russia, Assad's strongest international backer, to support a resolution that would invoke Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter and could have authorized the use of force or other action if Syria didn't disarm.
If Assad doesn't comply, the decision on how to punish him would go back to the Security Council, where Russia holds a veto. Moscow has steadfastly opposed military intervention in Syria and has questioned a U.N. investigation that determined chemical weapons were used in an attack on rebel-held suburbs of Damascus on Aug. 21, which the U.S. says killed more than 1,400 people. The U.S. and its allies say the U.N. report proves that the Assad government was behind the attack, but Russia has remain unconvinced.
Without the threat of force behind the deal, it's unclear whether  Assad will live up to his promise to give up his stockpile of illicit chemical warfare agents, one of the world's largest. U.S. officials say Syria possesses more than 1,000 tons of blister and nerve agents, including mustard, sarin and VX gases.
Supporters of the resolution say it will help advocates of strong penalties build support for action within the Security Council -- or outside it -- if Assad fails to comply with the disarmament deal.
U.S. officials say Assad’s forces have fired rockets or other munitions filled with chemical agents at least a dozen times against insurgents battling to overthrow him. The Aug. 21 attack, which involved sarin nerve gas, was the largest by far.
The State Department said the text that the five permanent Security Council members agreed to Thursday is "strong, binding and enforceable" and unites international opinion against the use of chemical weapons.
"This is historic and unprecedented because it puts oversight of the Assad regime’s compliance under international control," according to a State Department statement attributed to an unidentified senior official.
"Equally as important, it makes absolutely clear that failure of the Assad regime to comply will have consequences,” the statement added.
U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power tweeted that the resolution legally obligates Syria to give up its chemical weapons and "creates a new norm" against the use of poison gas.
Security Council members -- permanent members United States, Britain, France, Russia and China, and 10 rotating members -- were due to discuss the draft resolution in a closed session late Thursday. A vote could occur by the weekend.
Diplomats said the draft resolution roughly mirrors the framework agreement reached by Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on Sept. 14.
The deal required Assad to reveal all his chemical weapons and production facilities to international inspectors, to allow inspectors into Syria by the end of November, and to agree to have the entire toxic arsenal seized or destroyed by mid-2014.
Assad met the first benchmark, submitting what officials have called a “serious" initial disclosure of his weapons program last Friday to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
The international organization monitors compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international treaty that Assad signed this month and that bans the production, storage or use of poison gas.
Details of how the weapons would be impounded or destroyed have yet to be finalized. U.S. officials said the OPCW, which is based in The Hague, soon would determine those specifics in a plan that would closely match the terms set out in the Security Council resolution.
"These two texts are a matched set," a senior U.S. official said this week on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York. "They have to be congruent. They have to be mutually supporting."
A Western diplomat, who requested anonymity to describe the draft resolution, said it calls chemical weapons use a threat to international peace and security, condemns the Aug. 21 attack in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, commits to endorsing the OPCW disarmament plan and demands accountability if Assad reneges.
But it doesn't specify how Assad would be held accountable and includes no reference to the International Criminal Court , the world war crimes court, the official said.

The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have agreed on the most important elements of a draft resolution requiring Syria to surrender its chemical weapons, according to a UN diplomat.

WASHINGTON -- International inspectors may arrive in Syria as early as Tuesday to begin probing President Bashar Assad 's chemical weapons program, according to a draft decision released Friday by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
The Hague-based organization endorsed a U.S.-Russia plan to destroy all of Assad's toxic arsenal by mid-2014 and called on Syria to allow inspectors "immediate and unfettered access" to all of its chemical sites.
The draft decision, which was to be discussed at a meeting of the organization later Friday, came a day after the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council agreed on a resolution that legally requires Assad to relinquish his toxic stockpiles, believed to include 1,100 tons of sarin, mustard gas, VX and other agents.

WASHINGTON -- The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously Friday night to approve a resolution directing the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal, setting in motion an international effort expected to begin within days.
The council voted to accept a plan, negotiated between Russia and the United States, that lays heavy obligations on Syrian President Bashar Assad to cooperate with international inspectors in their efforts to dismantle his chemical weapons and threatens penalties if he doesn’t.
But any such penalties would have to be approved in separate votes by the Security Council. And Russia has been a firm defender of the Syrian government, a longtime ally.
The council’s vote came hours after the international organization charged with prohibiting the development and use of chemical weapons voted to accept a plan to carry out its duties in destroying the weapons.
           
The executive council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based in the Hague, said it would begin inspecting sites on Tuesday, working toward a goal of eliminating Syria's entire arsenal of chemical weapons by mid-2014.
 
The OPCW will be working on an accelerated schedule that calls for the destruction of production equipment by Nov. 1.
The U.N. vote followed weeks of both U.S. threats of military action and high-wire diplomacy after an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus, the Syrian capital. The United States blamed the Assad regime for the assault and said it had left about 1,400 people dead.
On Friday, President Obama described the diplomatic progress as “a potentially huge victory for the international community” and a validation of his strategy to threaten targeted missile strikes to pressure Assad while also pushing a diplomatic process aimed at ending Syria’s bitter civil war .
 
But skeptics, including many Republicans in Congress , said it remains to be seen whether the resolution will be enough to force Assad’s hand if he and his Russian allies decide to resist the efforts of the OPCW and U.N. officials.

Security Council agrees ‘unanimously’ on destruction of Syria chemicals
 
Major powers overcome prolonged deadlock to approve first council resolution on conflict, which is now 30 months old with more than 100,000 dead.
 
By Tim Witcher - UNITED NATIONS
Divisions over war remain clear
The UN Security Council unanimously passed a landmark resolution Friday ordering the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons and condemning a murderous poison gas attack in Damascus.
UN leader Ban Ki-moon, who called the resolution "the first hopeful news on Syria in a long time," said he hopes to convene a peace conference in mid-November.
The major powers overcame a prolonged deadlock to approve the first council resolution on the conflict, which is now 30 months old with more than 100,000 dead.
Resolution 2118, the result of bruising negotiations between the United States and Russia, gives international binding force to a plan drawn up by the two to eliminate President Bashar al-Assad's chemical arms.
The plan calls for Syria's estimated 1,000 tonnes of chemical weapons to be put under international control by mid-2014. Experts say the timetable is very tight.
International experts are expected to start work in Syria next week. Britain and China announced that they will offer finance to the disarmament operation.
Divisions over the war remained clear, however, in comments by their foreign ministers after the vote.
"Should the regime fail to act, there will be consequences," US Secretary of State John Kerry warned the 15-member council after the vote sealing a US-Russian agreement.
But Kerry hailed the resolution.
"The Security Council has shown that when we put aside politics for the common good, we are still capable of doing big things," he said.
There are no immediate sanctions over a chemical weapons attack, an event UN experts confirmed. But it allows for a new vote on possible measures if the Russia-US plan is breached.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stressed that there were no automatic punitive measures, and that the resolution applied equally to the Syrian opposition.
He said the council would take "actions which are commensurate with the violations, which will have to proven 100 percent."
Russia, Assad's main ally, has rejected any suggestion of sanctions or military force against Assad. It has already used its veto power as a permanent Security Council member to block three Western-drafted resolutions on Syria.
The resolution "condemns in the strongest terms any use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, in particular the attack on August 21, 2013, in violation of international law."
The United States says the attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta left more than 1,400 dead. It blamed Assad's government for the sarin gas assault and threatened a military strike over the attack.
The government has denied responsibility.
Should Syria not comply with the resolution, the Security Council members agreed to "impose measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter."
The charter can authorize the use of sanctions or military force. But diplomats said Russia would fiercely oppose any force against its ally. All sides agreed that new action will require a new vote.
Russia also rebuffed calls by European powers Britain and France for the Ghouta attack to be referred to the International Criminal Court.
The resolution expressed "strong conviction" that those responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria "should be held accountable."
It formally endorsed a decision taken hours earlier in The Hague by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to accept the Russia-US disarmament plan.
Ban said the resolution "will ensure that the elimination of the Syrian chemical weapons program happens as soon as possible and with the utmost transparency and accountability."
Ban also told the Security Council he wanted to hold a new Syria peace conference in November.
"We are aiming for a conference in mid-November," Ban said, adding that foreign ministers from Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States had agreed to make sure the two sides in the conflict negotiate in "good faith."
A first peace conference was held in June 2012 but there has been no follow up because of divisions in the Syrian opposition and the international community.
Ban will start contacts with his Syria peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi next week on setting the firm date and who will attend the new meeting, diplomats said.
"All violence must end. All the guns must fall silent," Ban said.
He also noted that the resolution was not "a license to kill" with conventional arms.
"A red light for one for one form of weapons does not mean a green light for others," Ban said.
The Security Council resolution gave backing to the 2012 conference declaration, which stated that there should be a transitional government in Syria with full executive powers.
It also determined that the new peace conference would be to decide how to implement the accord.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague said after the adoption of the resolution that the international community must now step up efforts to help those caught up in a humanitarian crisis.
Meanwhile in Syria, a car bomb north of Damascus detonated Friday, killing at least 30 people. Eleven more deaths were reported in a government air raid, highlighting the continued slaughter in Syria's long-running civil war.
"We must never forget that the catalog of horrors in Syria continues with bombs and tanks, grenades and guns," said Ban.

On Friday night, the United Nations Security Council unanimously voted into being a resolution they floated 24 hours earlier to great acclaim. The resolution, number 2118, was hammered out over the last two weeks by the Russians and the Americans, and is supposed to bring Syrian chemical weapons under international control and, ultimately, to destroy them. 
In Washington, the resolution, even when it first surfaced, was praised for the brilliance of its nuance. “This resolution breaks new ground,” U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power told a press scrum after the negotiations had ended. “The Security Council is establishing a new international norm.” National Security Advisor Susan Rice called it “a strong, binding and enforceable UNSC resolution.” A U.S. official told me it was “a breakthrough.” On Friday afternoon, President Obama called it “a major diplomatic breakthrough.” (Think Progress national security blogger Hayes Brown went so far as to tweet that it was “some next level genius stuff.”)
That is a political sell, of course, as well as a testament to how bad things had gotten on the Syrian question before 2118 arrived. Talk to anyone else, and the praise is far, far fainter. “It was the compromise version,” says Fyodr Lukyanov, the editor of Russia in Global Affairs. “It was predictable in the best way it could be,” said Cliff Kupchan, director for Eurasia and the Middle East for the Eurasia Group. “We’re very clear-eyed about this,” the U.S. official admitted.
This resolution is in fact a compromise, and, as such, it is a half-measure--even if, this day in age, half-measures are themselves quite the victory.
 
So what, exactly, does this resolution do and not do? Who wins, and who only sort of does?
On one hand, Resolution 2118 mentions Chapter VII, the part of the U.N. charter that can punish with economic sanctions or use of force—which is a concession to the Americans, who wanted something with teeth—but, on the other hand, is not a Chapter VII resolution—a concession to the Russians, who wanted mostly gums.
On one hand, it uses the kind of language a Chapter VII resolution uses—“shall” and “will” rather than “call on” or “encourage”—but, on the other hand, that mention of Chapter VII, the thing that stipulates punishment for infractions, does not come until a short clause at the end, a sort of coda.
On one hand, the resolution is supposed to be “legally binding,” but, on the other hand, it contains no specific consequences should Assad not do all the things the resolution says he has to do with his chemical weapon. So instead of including automatic triggers—“if this, then this”—Resolution 2118 simply says that penalties for Syrian non-compliance will be Chapter VII-type penalties, like economic sanctions or the use of force (a concession to the Americans). However, that is all it says. There are no specifics and no penalties outlined. This means that, should there be an infraction, the Security Council will again convene to determine what to do. This is a concession to the Russians, who have used their Security Council veto to protect Assad from the West. Given that the Russians are still muddying the waters and refusing to assign blame for the August 21 chemical attacks, how likely is it that they would vote for economic sanctions or use of force against Assad? “Russia will never vote for it,” says Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Center in Moscow and a noted scholar of Russian foreign policy. 
This was part of the compromise. From the beginning, Russia ruled out a Chapter VII resolution, while the U.S. pushed for something that would be binding and enforceable. As a result we have this strange, narrow document that, on one hand, delineates with great specificity how and when Assad shall part with his chemical weapons, yet has its teeth surgically removed and set aside for use at a later time, like a pair of dentures on the nightstand.
 
The compromise, however, allows all sides, including Assad’s, to walk away with a win. 
The Americans can say that they have enforced their red line against chemical weapons and have done so without using force or doing so unilaterally. (“Putin understands that Obama doesn’t want to use force is Syria, but feels obligated to do so,” says Lukyanov. “This resolution gives the Americans the chance to step away from a war they didn’t want to fight.”) It also saves them from being seen as the country that continues to gut the United Nations.
The Russians can also say that they have upheld international norms protecting national sovereignty and insuring against unilateral military action. And whereas American policy on Syria has been mercurial and ever-changing, the Russians’ goal has been steadfast for the entire duration of the Syrian civil war: blocking American military intervention. This resolution, because it tables the use of force and kicks that can down the road, allows them to do that.
Most important, the Russians emerge from this latest scuffle as the world’s master diplomats and, finally, as America’s geopolitical equals. This has been a major Russian goal—and a major reason for its zealous use of the Security Council veto—for the last decade: restoring Russia as a powerful global dealmaker. “Russia is not a vegetarian country,” says Trenin. “It is not against the use of force. It just wants the use of force to happen with Russia’s approval. Putin wants these things done on an equal footing, not that he’s just helping America pursue its own agenda and getting commission for it.” Reserving the right to veto any future consequences for Assad’s potential violations of Resolution 2118 allows Russia to maintain this equal footing.
Moreover, Trenin adds, for Russia, this has never been a fight about Assad (who was not the friend of Moscow that his father was) or even about Syria. “Syria is not the main point,” Trenin says. “Syria is where the new world order is being sorted out.” Because this resolution has been born of Putin’s plan—in Moscow, Sergey Lavrov is just seen as doing Putin’s bidding—“it raises Putin to a very high and very serious level.” Kupchan, a veteran and keen observer of Russia who was just in Moscow for the Valdai club discussions (Putin’s pet conference), was impressed by this as well. “I was very struck by how much Putin and Lavrov were putting the prestige of Russia on the line with this,” he said.
Assad also wins in all of this, precisely because Russia is seems committed to making this plan work and therefore making Assad get rid of his weapons. If Assad complies and turns over his chemical weapons to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (the body charged by the resolution to determine the mechanics of the purge), the Americans don’t strike Syria and Assad can stay in power and continue fighting the war. Both of these are a win for Russia, too. “Putin wants Assad to stay and keep fighting  what he sees as his own worst enemies: al-Qaida affiliated extremists,” says Trenin, adding that this is one of the ways the younger Assad became a Russian ally over the course of the war. “The fact that there are several hundred Russian citizens”—Muslim insurgents from Russia’s violent North Caucasus region—“makes this even more urgent for Putin.” As long as Assad complies with Resolution 2118, in other words, he takes away the need for American intervention. And as long as he does that, he can and should keep fighting to crush the rebels. 
That said, there is a consensus that Assad will probably stash some chemical weapons for a rainy day. “It is very unlikely that he’ll get rid of all of them,” says Kupchan. “But what would a strike have taken out? Five percent? Ten percent?” Even then, it is unlikely that he would use them unless things got really dire. It is even more unlikely that the U.S. could do anything about that or even about a secret stash. Why? Because Resolution 2118 requires that any consequences for such secret stashes be determined by the Security Council, and Russia will never vote for it. (Instead, according to Trenin, if Syria is found to be in violation of the treaty’s terms, “Russia will lean really hard on Assad, telling him that if he doesn’t fulfill his obligations, the U.S. will attack and we won’t be able to do anything about it.”) When the Security Council inevitably doesn’t approve the punishment, given the painfully fraught drama we went through at home over military intervention in Syria, it is deeply unlikely that Obama would decide to act on his own. And that means that all Assad has to do is make a convincing show of compliance and he’s off the hook.
 
The losers in this deal are painfully obvious. Obama, whose Syria policy is hugely driven by domestic politics, and Putin win because they were able to tease out the use of chemical weapons from larger context of the bloody Syrian civil war, which this resolution completely ignores. “Of course we welcome efforts to lock away Syria’s chemical weapons; it’s definitely essential to address this,” says Philippe Bolopion, the who represents Human Rights Watch at the U.N. “But the resolution does not address the reality that conventional weapons have killed the vast majority of people in this conflict.” He also takes issue that the red line was drawn for chemical weapons in this conflict. “What about the incendiary bombs being dropped on schools? What about the Scud missiles leveling whole neighborhoods? These are not pretty weapons either.”
After the unanimous vote on Friday night, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon delivered a speech praising Resolution 2118 for breaking the deadlock. It has. Its esoteric compromise has also delivered massive political wins to Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Bashar al-Assad. He praised the effort that would lead to Syria destroying its chemical weapons program. “A red light for one type of weapon is not a green light for others,” he warned. Except that this is exactly what Resolution 2118 does.

Syrian official promises cooperation with U.N. team

Posted: Sunday, September 29, 2013, 2:02 AM
BEIRUT - Syria's prime minister said Saturday the nation would cooperate fully with U.N. inspectors charged with securing and destroying its chemical weapons stockpile.
Wael al-Halqi made the comments a day after the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to purge Syria of chemical weapons. The U.N. resolution, passed after two weeks of negotiations, marked a major breakthrough in the paralysis that has gripped the council since the Syrian uprising began in March 2011.
"This resolution is in line with Syria's approach toward joining the chemical weapons convention," Halqi said in an interview with Lebanon's Al Manar TV. "Syria will stand by what it promised. We will cooperate and facilitate the work of the inspectors. We have provided lists with the chemical weapons we have, and they can check all our institutions."
The resolution allows the start of a mission to rid Syria of its estimated 1,000-ton chemical arsenal by mid-2014. It also calls for consequences if President Bashar al-Assad's regime fails to comply, although those will depend on the council's passing another resolution in the event of noncompliance.
The vote also enshrined a plan adopted by the world's chemical weapons watchdog laying out benchmarks and time lines for cataloguing, quarantining, and ultimately destroying Syria's chemical arms, their precursors, and delivery systems.
The diplomatic developments of the last two weeks are rooted in the Aug. 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb. The United States blamed the Assad regime for the attack and threatened to launch punitive missile strikes.
That set in motion the diplomatic maneuvering that led to Friday's resolution.
For the first time, the council also endorsed the plan for a political transition in Syria adopted by key nations in June 2012, and called for an international conference to be convened as soon as possible to implement it. U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon has set mid-November as a target date for a new peace conference in Geneva.
Speaking to Al Manar, Halqi said the Syrian government was ready to "negotiate with opposition forces both inside and outside of Syria if they're willing to." But he also questioned whether the main Western-backed opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, could bring armed groups on the ground to the negotiating table.
The coalition's control over the myriad rebel factions fighting in Syria has always been shaky, but that was laid bare Wednesday after nearly a dozen of the most powerful rebel groups formally broke with it.
In Syria on Saturday, rebels including members of an al-Qaeda-linked group captured a military post on the border with Jordan after four days of fighting. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights activist group said 26 soldiers were killed in the battle as well as a number of rebels, including seven foreign fighters.

On September 27, UNSC Resolution 2118 was unanimously adopted calling for the destruction of Syriaâ€™s chemical weapons.
All hailed the Resolution including the Syrian Ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar Jaafari.
Without a doubt, and thanks to Russian diplomatic efforts and Bashar al-Assadâ€™s readiness to cooperate, direct military action against Syria was suspended.
Inarguably, when war is averted, there is cause for celebration. And yet, it seems we canâ€™t see the forest for the tree.
There has been zero evidence that the Syrian government used chemical weapons on August 21 or at any other time.
While the UN inspectors report did confirm the use of chemical weapons, it was outside its mandate to determine who carried out the heinous crime. Western experts were quick to point to the trajectory of the rockets as evidence of Assadâ€™s involvement conveniently leaving unmentioned the important possibility of mobile launching by non-government forces.
While there is no evidence (or motive) pointing to the Assad government there is little doubt among analysts that the rebels were responsible for the chemical attacks. Colonel Wilkerson, a former high-ranking Bush era official has pointed to the possibility of a false flag operation by the Israelis. Analysts are not alone.
For well over a year prior to the August 21 incident, Iranian officials had warned Washington and voiced their concern that rebels had acquired chemical weapons. Turkey, Washingtonâ€™s ally and culprit in the assault on Syriaâ€™s sovereignty, arrested rebels who possessed the nerve agent Sarin.
Most importantly, the US military claimed that the rebels had chemical weapons. Russia claimed it had evidence that the rebels were responsible. So what happened?
UNSC Resolution 2118 sent a loud and clear message. Terrorists can get away with mass killing - even if they use chemical weapons.
The provision to safeguard against future use of chemical weapons is not without its irony: â€œUnderscores that no party in Syria should use, develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, retain, or transfer chemical weapons.â€�
Given that that in face of solid indication to the contrary, the Assad government was held responsible for the chemical attacks which resulted in the passing of UNSC 2118 - exonerating the culprits.
A new and dangerous precedent has been set amidst the sight of relief.

UNITED NATIONS | Fri Sep 27, 2013 7:07pm EDT
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council is set to adopt a resolution on Friday on eradicating Syria's chemical arsenal after Russia and the United States overcame a bitter deadlock to avert U.S. military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.
Amid newfound unity of the veto-wielding council members - Russia, China, France, the United States and Britain - French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he hoped a date would also be agreed on Friday for so-called Geneva 2 peace talks on Syria.
"I hope we will be able to set a date so that Geneva 2 can finally take place because the only solution is political. We moved forward on the chemical side but people are continuing to kill each other on the ground," Fabius told reporters.
The five big U.N. powers are due to meet Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and international Syria mediator Lakhdar Brahimi on Friday on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly. Diplomats said if a date was set for the peace talks in Geneva, it would likely be November, as October appeared too ambitious.
U.N. diplomats said the full 15-member Security Council was expected to vote on the chemical weapons resolution at 8 p.m. (0000 GMT) on Friday. It will also be the first time the council formally endorses a plan for a political transition in Syria agreed at an international conference in Geneva in June 2012.
U.S. President Barack Obama said the draft U.N. resolution was a "potentially huge victory for the international community" and described it as legally binding, verifiable and enforceable.
A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the resolution deflected attention from Obama's wavering on the Syrian conflict. "For the U.S., this resolution turns the attention away from its powerlessness," he said.
Assad agreed to destroy Syria's chemical weapons following global outrage over a sarin gas attack in the Damascus suburbs last month - the world's deadliest chemical attack in 25 years.
Western powers blame Assad, while Assad's government and its close ally, Russia, say the rebels were responsible.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia continued to work "energetically" to help convene Syria peace talks.
"People continue to die and peaceful civilians suffer every day in Syria," he told the U.N. General Assembly. "Virtually the only possibility today to put an end to this turmoil is to move from a deadlock to the process of political settlement of the Syrian crisis."
As a precursor to the U.N. vote, the 41-member Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons approved a decision in The Hague on Friday laying out procedures to rapidly verify and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. The decision will see inspectors sent to Syria starting Tuesday.
INTERNATIONAL VICTORY
The five big U.N. powers ended weeks of diplomatic deadlock on Thursday by agreeing to the draft Security Council resolution - based on a deal reached by Moscow and Washington earlier this month - that demands Syria give up its chemical weapons.
Until recently, the council has been paralyzed on how to deal with the Syrian civil war. Russia, backed by China, has vetoed three resolutions since October 2011 that would have condemned Assad's government and threatened it with sanctions.
Western powers on the Security Council conceded they had backed away from many of their initial demands during negotiations. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov claimed a victory, saying Moscow had stood its ground on opposing any threats of military force against Syria.
A major sticking point had been Russia's opposition to writing the resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, which covers its authority to enforce its decisions with measures such as sanctions or military force.
The compromise draft resolution makes the measure legally binding, but provides for no means of automatic enforcement if Syria fails to comply, as the United States, Britain and France originally wanted.
"No concessions have been made," Ryabkov told Voice of Russia radio. "The main thing is that the automatic use of Chapter 7 has been ruled out."
France's Fabius told reporters, "We shall see in the coming days and weeks if the Russians are really coherent with what they proposed and the vote ... we will need to be vigilant on the action or inaction of Syria."
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power described the draft resolution as "very significant" because, when adopted, it would be the first time during the conflict that the council had imposed binding obligations on Assad.
"Taking chemical weapons away from a regime that just used chemical weapons ... is a very intense form of accountability," Power said on Thursday. "I don't think anybody can discount the role that the threat of limited military action played in expediting and catalyzing this conversation."
Obama has asked Congress to authorize the use of limited military strikes to punish Assad for the Damascus gas attack. The deal between Russia and the United States to rid Syria of its chemical weapons averted those strikes for now.
British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said he was pleased the draft resolution called for "accountability" for those responsible for the chemical attacks. He added, however, that he would have liked a reference to the International Criminal Court in The Hague - something diplomats said Russia opposed.
To impose further measures, like sanctions or military action, on the Syrian government for non-compliance with the chemical weapons deal, the Security Council would need to agree on a second resolution.
The United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed in the civil war, after the government tried to crush pro-democracy protests, and more than half of Syria's 20 million people need help.

WASHINGTON | Fri Sep 27, 2013 1:55pm EDT
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Friday a U.N. Security Council draft resolution brokered by the United States and Russia that would demand Syria give up its chemical arms was "a potentially huge victory for the international community."
The resolution, agreed on Thursday, would not threaten military force if Syria fails to comply.
A vote on the resolution is expected later on Friday.
Obama said the agreement was something the United States had long sought and likely would not have been achieved without a credible threat of U.S. force after the chemical weapons attack on a suburb of Damascus on August 21 that killed scores of Syrian civilians, including children.
"The fact that we now have a framework ... that would be legally binding, that would be verifiable and enforceable, where there would be consequences for Syria's failure to meet what has been set forth in this resolution, I think is a potentially huge victory for the international community," Obama said at the White House, where he was meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Obama said the resolution would deter future use of chemical weapons in Syria and go beyond what military action could have achieved by removing one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world.
He said the United States was hopeful about what could be accomplished as a result of the U.N. resolution, but that a lot of work was still required and skepticism was well placed.
"I think rightly, people have been concerned about whether Syria will follow through on the commitments that have been laid forth, and I think there are legitimate concerns as to how technically we are going to be getting those chemical weapons out while there is still fighting going on," Obama said.
"Nevertheless, this represents potentially a significant step forward."
The agreement emerged from intense negotiations at the United Nations with Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.
A major sticking point was Russia's opposition to writing the resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, which covers the council's authority to enforce its decisions with measures that include sanctions or military force.
The draft resolution makes the measure legally binding but provides no means for automatic enforcement if Syria fails to comply.

UNITED NATIONS | Fri Sep 27, 2013 8:05am EDT
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Ending weeks of diplomatic deadlock, the United States and Russia agreed on Thursday on a U.N. Security Council draft resolution that would demand Syria give up its chemical arms, but does not threaten military force if it fails to comply.
Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said a deal was struck with Russia "legally obligating" Syria to give up its chemical stockpile and the measure went to the full Security Council in a closed-door meeting on Thursday night. U.N. diplomats said a vote could come within 24 hours.
"Just two weeks ago, tonight's outcome seemed utterly unimaginable," Power said. "Two weeks ago, the Syrian regime had not even acknowledged the existence of its chemical weapons stockpiles."
"But tonight we have a shared draft resolution that was the outcome of intense diplomacy and negotiations over the past two weeks," she said.
U.S., Russian, French and British diplomats told reporters the vote could come as early as Friday evening, provided the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague approves a plan for the destruction of Syria's poison gas arsenal beforehand.
"I know that some (foreign) ministers are extending their stay in New York in order to participate in that vote," Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters.
The agreement emerged from intense negotiations at the United Nations with Russia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's chief ally. The aim was to craft a measure to require destruction of Syria's chemical arsenal in line with a U.S.-Russian deal reached earlier this month that averted American strikes on Assad's forces in the midst of a bloody civil war.
Western powers on the Security Council backed away from many of their initial demands, diplomats say, in order to secure Russia's approval. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said an "understanding" had been hammered out, but gave no details.
A major sticking point had been Russia's opposition to writing the resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, which covers the council's authority to enforce its decisions with measures such as sanctions or military force.
The compromise draft resolution, obtained by Reuters, makes the measure legally binding, but provides for no means of automatic enforcement as the United States, Britain and France originally wanted.
Power said the resolution was groundbreaking because the council, which has been deadlocked for years on the Syrian civil war, formally endorsed for the first time a plan for a political transition in Syria that was agreed on at an international conference in Geneva in June 2012.
'BREAKTHROUGH'
The only reference to enforcement in the draft is a threat that if Syria fails to comply with the resolution, the council would impose unspecified punitive measures under Chapter 7, which would require a second resolution that Russia could veto.
A U.S. State Department official hailed the deal as a "breakthrough."
"The Russians have agreed to support a strong, binding and enforceable resolution that unites the pressure and focus of the international community on the Syrian regime to ensure the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons," the official said.
Diplomats from the permanent Security Council members - China, Russia, the United States, France and Britain - had been haggling over the details of a resolution to back the American-Russian accord announced on September 14 in Geneva to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons.
Assad agreed to destroy Syria's chemical weapons amid an international outcry over a sarin gas strike in the suburbs of Damascus last month - the world's deadliest chemical attack in 25 years.
Washington has blamed Assad's forces for the attack, which it said killed more than 1,400 people, and President Barack Obama threatened a U.S. military strike in response.
Russia and Assad have blamed the attack on rebels battling to overthrow him in a civil war that, according to the United Nations, has left more than 100,000 people dead.
British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said he was pleased the draft resolution called for "accountability" for those responsible for the chemical attacks, although he added he would have liked a direct reference to the International Criminal Court in The Hague - something diplomats said Russia opposed.
TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS
In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Obama sought to persuade world leaders to apply pressure on Damascus with a resolution that included tough consequences should Assad not surrender his chemical weapons stockpiles in a verifiable way.
But by putting the Syria crisis back in the hands of the U.N. Security Council where Russia has the ability to block punitive action, the chances of U.S. military action appeared to recede even further. Obama faces tough opposition from a skeptical Congress and a war-wary public on the wisdom of intervening military in Syria.
With rebel forces plagued by divisions, the Friends of Syria - a bloc of mainly Western and Gulf Arab countries plus Turkey -followed up Thursday's announcement of the draft resolution with a pledge to boost aid to the opposition. Weapons shipments to the rebels have been inadequate to shift the military balance in their favor.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday that Syria "will implode before any side would claim a military victory" and that all sides needed to move rapidly to put a political solution in place to end the conflict.
A senior U.S. official said earlier that the United States and China - another permanent Security Council member - strongly agreed on the need to quickly adopt a binding resolution on eradicating Syria's chemical arsenal, a remark that appeared aimed at putting pressure on Russia to accept the measure.
Russia at first appeared unswayed.
Kerry met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for about an hour on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.
After the draft resolution was announced, the Chinese foreign minister said, "The major concerns of all the parties, including China's concerns, have basically been resolved."
China has backed Russia to veto three council resolutions since October 2011 that would have condemned Assad's government and threatened it with sanctions.
Western diplomats say Beijing has little reason to support Assad but is eager to ensure Russia will continue to back it in the Security Council on issues like North Korea.
Assad's government last week disclosed to a U.N.-backed weapons watchdog the extent of its arsenal, meeting the first deadline of the ambitious disarmament deal that calls for the weapons to be eliminated by June 2014.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Thursday that his country was ready to help guard Syrian chemical weapons sites and destroy Assad's stockpiles but would not ship any of the chemical arms to Russia for destruction.
FRAGMENTED OPPOSITION
The head of the opposition Syrian Supreme Military Council cut short a visit to France on Thursday and said he would head to Syria on Friday for talks with rebel brigades that broke with the Western-backed coalition.
General Salim Idris, who commands the coalition's military wing known as the Free Syrian Army, or FSA, said he would meet with fighters from the 13 groups that rejected on Tuesday the authority of the Turkey-based coalition.
The rebel groups, including at least three considered to be under the FSA umbrella, called on Tuesday for the rebel forces to be reorganized under an Islamic framework and to be run only by groups fighting inside Syria.
Thousands of Syrian rebels have broken with the Western-backed coalition and called for a new Islamist front, undermining international efforts to build up a pro-Western military force to replace Assad.

AMSTERDAM | Sat Sep 28, 2013 6:11am EDT
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Experts from the world's chemical weapons watchdog will begin inspecting Syria's stockpile of toxic munitions by Tuesday, according to an agreement passed in The Hague on Friday.
The agreement enables the U.N. Security Council to vote later on Friday on a draft resolution on eradicating Syria's chemical arsenal.
The decision adopted by the Executive Council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, OPCW, called on members to make cash donations to fund Syria's fast-tracked destruction operation.
The 41-member executive council of the OPCW passed the agreement in meetings that ran past midnight.
"It's done and dusted," said spokesman Michael Luhan. "It passed by consensus."
It requests urgent funding to hire inspectors and technical experts to destroy what Western intelligence agencies believe is about 1,000 tonnes of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agents, built up over decades and spread over dozens of locations.
An OPCW official said an advance team would head for Syria on Monday.
Established to enforce the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, the OPCW has an annual budget of under $100 million and fewer than 500 staffers. It does not have the manpower to carry out the task without significantly increasing resources.
Experts have said it will be risky and expensive to destroy the chemicals in Syria, where a civil war has killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions more.
Syria has just nine months to do what some countries, including Russia and the United States, have taken more than a decade to do.
UNFETTERED ACCESS
Syria is instructed to provide inspectors with security and "immediate and unfettered" access to all sites. A failure to do so will trigger a meeting by the OPCW's core members within 24 hours, the decision says.
The Security Council resolution to be voted on Friday does not refer to the use of force as a means to enforce the destruction plan, a point which Washington had pressed for.
The OPCW inspectors will have 30 days to visit all chemical weapons facilities declared by Syria to the organization last week, it states.
It is still unclear where and how the chemicals stockpile, the details of which have not been made public by the OPCW, will be destroyed. For most countries, the process often takes years, but Syria has been given until mid-2014.
The agreement contains roughly the same destruction deadlines as in a Russian-American deal brokered earlier this month. Syria must submit additional details of its arsenal, including munitions types, amounts of precursors and toxins, and the location of all storage and production sites within a week.
Syria will appoint a point person within the Syrian government for chemical weapons and must have completed by November 1 the destruction of all chemical weapon production and mixing/filling facilities, the decision states.

BEIRUT | Sat Sep 28, 2013 12:37pm EDT
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Rebel fighters including foreign Islamists took control of a military post on Syria's southern border with Jordan on Saturday after four days of heavy fighting with President Bashar al-Assad's forces, activists said.
The former customs post on the edge of the city of Deraa, where Syria's uprising against Assad erupted in 2011, was seized by several groups including the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front and the Islamist Ahrar al-Sham, according to the reports.
A video from the site showed a masked fighter claiming victory in the name of the two movements, and a captured tank from which a black Islamist flag was fluttering.
Rebels also seized a fuel depot north of Damascus, the Syrian Observatory for Human Right said, while state media said Assad's forces made gains in rebel areas of east Damascus.
The fighting across Syria highlights the relentless nature of its civil war, as battles with conventional weapons rage on regardless of steps to destroy Syria's chemical arms - the result of a rare outbreak of international consensus on Syria.
An August 21 sarin gas attack, which prompted global condemnation and led the United States and Russia to bridge some of their deep divisions over the Syrian conflict, killed hundreds of people in rebel-held areas of the capital.
But similar numbers die every week in air strikes and artillery fire by Assad's forces and by guns, rockets, mortars and tanks deployed by both sides.
The British-based Observatory, an anti-Assad group which monitors violence through security and medical sources inside Syria, said 170 people were killed on Friday, including soldiers, rebels and civilians.
Authorities restrict media operations in Syria, making it difficult to confirm reports from activists or official sources.
REBEL TUNNELS
Syria's state news agency SANA said the army made major advances in the eastern Damascus districts of Jobar, Qaboun and Zamalka, where they found a network of rebel tunnels, used by the rebels to store weapons.
It quoted a local army commander saying one of the rebel tunnels was 150 meters long. In some of the tunnels the army found armor-piercing explosives weighing 30-40 kg, as well as French-made anti-tank rocket launchers and parts of anti-aircraft guns, the report said.
The three eastern districts where the army reported making advances are on the edge of the Ghouta district which was hit by chemical weapons last month.
United Nations inspectors said in a report two weeks ago that sarin was used in the attack. Western powers said the report showed Assad's forces were responsible for the attack, an accusation which the president and his Russian allies have denied, pointing the blame at rebels.
The inspectors returned to Syria on Tuesday to continue investigations into allegations of chemical and biological weapons use, including three previously unreported cases around Damascus in the days following the Aug 21 attack.
A car carrying members of the team was seen leaving their Damascus hotel on Saturday morning but there was no indication of where they were heading. They are due to complete their work in Syria on Monday and present a full report by late October.
The day after that team completes its mission, experts from the international watchdog the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will begin inspecting Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons, under the terms of a deal struck this month which averted U.S. military action.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council would be prepared to take punitive steps in the event of confirmed violations of a resolution demanding the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday.
"The United Nations Security Council ... will stand ready to take action under Chapter 7 of the (U.N.) charter, quite clearly," Lavrov said after the council unanimously approved the resolution. He was referring to the part of the charter covering the council's power to enforce its decisions with sanctions or military force. Any such steps would require a new resolution.
Separately, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said world powers were aiming to hold an international peace conference in mid-November to help put an end to Syria's 2-1/2 year civil war.

Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore has said the United Nations Security Council adoption of a binding resolution to destroy Syria's chemical weapons marks a "watershed" in the international community's engagement on the crisis.
Mr Gilmore was addressing the UN General Assembly in New York tonight.
He said Ireland has consistently argued that the UN and the Security Council must be central to any efforts to resolve this crisis.
He added that "while it has taken much longer than we would all have wished", he welcomed the decisive action.
The UNSC earlier today voted unanimously in favour of the draft resolution.
The vote by the 15-member council ends weeks of intense diplomacy between Russia and the US.
It breaks more than two years of UN deadlock over Syria, where fighting between government forces and rebels rages on.
Speaking after the vote in New York, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said it was a "historic" decision.
Mr Ban also said an international peace conference on Syria is planned for mid-November
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the UN Security Council would be prepared to take punitive steps in the event of confirmed violations of the resolution.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Eamon Gilmore is also due to meet the UN Secretary General.
Their talks are expected to focus on the ongoing conflict in Syria and the Middle East peace process as well as world poverty.

Assad's future 'not up for discussion'
Updated: 14:02, Sunday September 29, 2013
Syria is 'comfortable' with a UN  Security Council resolution on destroying its chemical weapons and  will not discuss the future of President Bashar al-Assad, the  country's foreign minister says.
Walid Muallem told reporters on Saturday the resolution voted by  the 15-nation council late on Friday meant the opposition could be  the target of UN sanctions.
'I am comfortable with the resolution,' Muallem said at the UN  headquarters where he will give Syria's address to the UN General  Assembly on Monday.
'It calls for Chapter VII against the terrorists,' the foreign  minister added, referring to the opposition groups battling to  overthrow Assad.
The resolution allows the Organisation for the Prohibition of  Chemical Weapons to start a mission this week to collect and  destroy Syria's arms.
It does not allow for immediate sanctions under Chapter VII of  the UN Charter in Syria, but there could be a new vote on measures  if the disarmament accord is violated.
The UN says chemical weapons were used in an August 21 attack in  Damascus that left hundreds dead. The United States and other  western nations blame government forces for the killings. Assad's  government says opposition rebels were behind the sarin gas attack.
Muallem said he was 'worried' that opposition groups have  chemical weapons.
The UN hopes to organise a Syria peace conference in  mid-November to negotiate a transitional government. But Muallem  signalled there could be no talk of Assad's departure.
'There can be no discussion of the future of President Assad. It  is in the constitution,' Muallem said.
Muallem said Assad was determined to see out his term and would  stand for re-election.
Assad has said there will be an election in 2014.
Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has demanded that  chemical attacks in Syria be investigated by the International  Criminal Court.
Westerwelle welcomed the resolution passed by the UN Security  Council on Friday.
'These weapons must be completely destroyed in accordance with a  firmly agreed timetable. Germany is prepared to provide financial  and technical help to destroy these chemical weapons,' he said.

The United Nations Security Council has unanimously approved an agreement to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons.
The council voted 15-0 to adopt a resolution drafted by the US, Britain and France in response to an August 21  gas attack in Damascus that killed more than 1400 people.
The resolution lacks immediate consequences if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad fails to comply and does not assign blame for the attack, which US, British and French officials attribute to Dr Assad's regime.
Russia, a Syrian ally, has blamed rebels for the August gas attack and blocked tougher wording on the Security Council resolution.

Russian vetoes of previous UN attempts to sanction Dr Assad made Saturday's vote the first diplomatic breakthrough at the UN since Syria's civil war began 2½ years ago.
''Today's historical resolution is the first hopeful news on Syria in a long time,'' UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.
The Security Council voted after the executive council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the world body in The Hague that monitors compliance with the  treaty banning chemical arms, adopted a blueprint to verify, remove, and destroy Dr Assad's arsenal of sarin and other chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The chemical weapons organisation's 41-nation executive council spent almost two weeks in closed-door discussions as the US, its allies and Russia debated the text of the UN resolution.
The plan approved earlier on Friday in The Hague outlines the mission the group will undertake in Syria and lays out the procedures for inspecting and eliminating Dr Assad's arsenal. The UN document ensures that the mission is enforceable and legally verifiable, the official said. The OPCW said its executive council agreed on an ''accelerated program'' for the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons and related material and will begin inspections in Syria by October 1.
''This decision sends an unmistakable message that the international community is coming together to work for peace in Syria, beginning with the elimination of chemical weapons in that country,'' OPCW director-general Ahmet Uzumcu said.
Syrian opposition leader Ahmad al-Jarba said the  pact would not end the suffering in Syria.
The resolution, Mr Ban told the Security Council, ''is is not a licence to kill with conventional weapons''.
The UN action follows two weeks of whirlwind diplomacy after Russia and the United States reached an agreement in Geneva to avert an American military strike against Syria if Dr Assad agreed to relinquish his poison gas arsenal.
Friday's UN resolution states that Syria ''shall not use, develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons, or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to other states or non-state actors.''
If Syria does not comply or participates in ''unauthorised transfer of chemical weapons,'' or if there is ''any use of chemical weapons by anyone in the Syrian Arab Republic,'' the Security Council can move to ''impose measures under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter''.
The Security Council then would discuss alleged violations, with individual members able to present their own intelligence on the event and permanent members, such as Russia, able to wield a veto against any final decision.
The charter's Chapter 7 allows the world body to take action, including the use of force, in response to acts of aggression or threats against peace.
The UN will send an ''advance team'' for preliminary assistance to the OPCW, and the two groups will report to the council every 30 days on the mission's progress.

John Key made a stinging attack on the UN Security Council.

Mayors to hold greater sway Courts shake-up unveiled by Justice minister Key urges action on nuclear disarmament Opposition to monorail 'increasing' At risk families jump housing queue
Prime Minister Jonn Key has wrapped up his visit to the United Nations by announcing aid for Syria as the Security Council unanimously agreed on a deal to eradicate Syria's chemical weapons.
The Security Council vote follows mounting condemnation of its paralysis on Syria after two and half years of bloodshed.
The resolution imposes binding obligations on the Syrian regime to dispose of its chemical weapons arsenal, but it does not authorise automatic use of force if Syria is in violation, which was previously a demand of the United States.
The Security Council could still impose measures if Syria fails to comply with the eradication programme under Chapter seven of the United Nations charter, which can include the use of force.
Key, who made a stinging attack on the Security Council in his address to the UN General Assembly yesterday, said the resolution did not go as far as New Zealand would have liked in holding the Assad regime to account.
"But it does do the most important job which is set out a programme for how chemical weapons will be collected up in Syria, destruction of those chemical weapons and hopefully a process for ensuring Syrians are kept safe form weapons that should never be deployed from anybody."
He announced a contribution of $US500,000 towards the eradication of Syria's chemical weapons and $US2 million in humanitarian aid.
The passing of Security Council vote comes after two weeks of intense negotiations marked a major breakthrough in the paralysis that has gripped the council since the Syrian uprising began. Russia and China previously vetoed three Western-backed resolutions pressuring President Bashar Assad's regime to end the violence.
"Today's historic resolution is the first hopeful news on Syria in a long time," UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the council immediately after the vote.
Key's trip to New York for the general assembly was part of a push by New Zealand for a seat on the Security Council in 2015-16, one of 10 non permanent seats on the organisation.
He said yesterday the trip had gone better than expected and he was confident that New Zealand's bid for a seat had momentum.
He also announced yesterday the establishment of diplomatic repreentation in the Caribbean, a region of the world with significant clout on international bodies because it commands 15 votes.
Key, who arrived at the UN straight from France and Britain, is due to fly out of New York tonight.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The world’s chemical weapons watchdog has approved a disarmament plan for Syria.
The decision late Friday paves the way for the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution enshrining the plan, which will make it legally binding.
The resolution, already agreed on by the five veto-wielding members, is expected to pass easily, breaking a nearly three-year deadlock on the council, which had been deeply divided on Syria.
Earlier Friday in Washington, President Barack Obama said a deal reached on a United Nations resolution to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons is “potentially a huge victory for the international community.”
The draft resolution’s demands that Syria abandon its chemical stockpile and allow unfettered access to chemical weapons experts are legally binding. But if Syria fails to comply, the council will need to adopt a second resolution to impose consequences.
Obama said during an Oval Office meeting with India’s prime minister that he is “very hopeful for the prospects of what can be accomplished.”
He applauded a framework that is legally binding, verifiable and enforceable. And he argued his threat of military strikes was crucial to reaching the agreement, but he always preferred a diplomatic solution.
The inspectors responsible for tracking down Syria’s chemical arms stockpile and verifying its destruction plan to start in Syria by Tuesday. They will face their tightest deadlines ever and work right in the heart of a war zone, according to a draft decision obtained Friday by The Associated Press.
The decision is the key to any U.N. resolution on Syria’s chemical weapons program.
The five permanent members of the deeply divided U.N. Security Council reached agreement Thursday on a resolution to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons. A vote depends on how soon the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is meeting later Friday at its headquarters in The Hague, can adopt its plan for securing and destroying Syria’s stockpile.
U.N. diplomats say the Security Council hopes to meet Friday evening to vote on the resolution, but that depends on events in The Hague.
The draft agreed upon by Russia, China, the United States, France and Britain includes two legally binding demands — that Syria abandons its chemical stockpile and allows unfettered access to the chemical weapons experts.
If Syria fails to comply, the draft says the Security Council would need to adopt a second resolution to impose possible military and other actions on Damascus under Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter.
Issam Khalil, a member of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s ruling Baath party, portrayed the deal as an American diplomatic failure.
“The resolution does not include threats or even possibilities of misinterpretations in a way that would let America and its allies to take advantage of it as they did in Iraq,” Khalil said in Damascus.
Nonetheless, after 2 ½ years of paralysis, the agreement represents a breakthrough for the Security Council and rare unity between Russia, which supports Assad’s government, and the United States, which backs the opposition.
The diplomatic push to find some agreement on Syria was triggered by an Aug. 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb and President Barack Obama’s subsequent threat to use military force.
The U.S. and Russia agree that Syria has roughly 1,000 metric tons of chemical weapons agents and precursors, including blister agents such as sulfur and mustard gas and nerve agents like sarin.
A group of U.N. inspectors already on the ground in Syria investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons said Friday they are probing a total of seven sites of suspected attacks, including the Damascus suburb where hundreds were killed last month. That number was raised from three sites previously.
Even as diplomatic headway was being made, Syria was wracked by more violence Friday: activists said a car bomb near a mosque killed at least 30 people.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group that monitors the crisis, said the explosion struck as worshippers at the al-Sahel mosque in Rankous were leaving after Friday prayers.
Residents of Rankous, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Damascus, later held funerals for some of the bombing victims. At one funeral, several rockets fired by government troops fell nearby, wounding some of the mourners, activist Mohammed Saeed said.
Car bombs, shelling and airstrikes have become common in Syria’s civil war, which has killed more than 100,000 people and driven another 7 million — around a third of the country’s pre-war population — from their homes since March 2011. The conflict has heavily damaged cities and Syria’s social fabric as it has taken on increasingly dark sectarian overtones, pitting a primarily Sunni Muslim rebel movement against a regime dominated by Assad’s Alawite sect.
The proposal being discussed Friday by the OPCW would allow inspectors into any site suspected of chemical weapons involvement even if Syria’s government did not identify the location. That gives the inspectors unusually broad authority.
The draft calls for the organization’s secretariat to start inspections “as soon as possible and no later than” Tuesday and sets a target of destroying all of Syria’s chemical weapons and equipment by the first half of 2014.
It calls on Syria to “cooperate fully with all aspects of the implementation of this decision” and let the inspectors examine any location they choose.
Once the plan is approved, it gives Damascus a week to give detailed information on its arsenal, including the name and quantity of all chemicals in its stockpile; the type and quantity of munitions that can be used to fire chemical weapons and the location of weapons, storage facilities and production facilities. All chemical weapons production and mixing equipment should be destroyed no later than Nov. 1.
In an indication of the enormity of the task ahead, the OPCW also appealed for donations to fund the disarmament, saying it will have to hire new weapons inspectors and chemical experts.
The diplomatic turning point came when U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Assad could avert U.S. military action by turning over “every single bit of his chemical weapons” to international control within a week. Russia quickly agreed.
Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signed a deal on Sept. 13 to put Syria’s chemical weapons under international control for later destruction. Assad’s government accepted the deal and quickly signed up to Chemical Weapons Convention that is policed by the Hague-based OPCW.
Meanwhile, a group of international war crimes experts is calling for the creation of a war crimes court in Damascus to try top-ranking Syrian politicians, soldiers or rebels when the country’s civil war ends.
Professor Michael Scharf of Case Western Reserve University told The Associated Press that draft statutes for such a court have been quietly under development for nearly two years.
Scharf said the group is going public now to push the issue of accountability for war crimes in Syria in hopes that will deter combatants from committing further atrocities.
Syria is not a party to the International Criminal Court — the permanent war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands — so the ICC does not have jurisdiction over war crimes there.
In Geneva, the U.N.’s top human rights body on Friday condemned what it called “systematic and widespread” rights violations by Syrian government forces.
The Human Rights Council, meeting in Geneva, voted 40-1 with six abstentions to approve a resolution condemning “continued gross, systematic and widespread violations of human rights ... by the Syrian authorities and affiliated militias” and “any human rights abuses” by opposition groups.

House Republicans insisting on health care concessions in plan to avert government shutdown
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Locked in a deepening struggle with President Barack Obama, the Republican-controlled House pushed legislation toward passage Saturday night imposing a one-year delay on parts of the nation's new health care law and repealing a tax on medical devices as the price for avoiding a partial government shutdown in a few days' time.
Senate Democrats pledged to reject the measure even before the House began debating it, and the White House issued a statement vowing a veto in any event. Republicans are pursuing "a narrow ideological agenda ... and pushing the government towards shutdown," it said.
As the day wore on, even some Republicans said privately they feared that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., held the advantage in the fast-approaching end game. If so, a House GOP rank and file that includes numerous tea party allies would soon have to choose between triggering the first partial shutdown in nearly two decades -- or coming away from the confrontation empty-handed.
Undeterred, House Republicans pressed ahead with their latest attempt to squeeze a concession from the White House in exchange for letting the government open for business normally on Tuesday. "Obamacare is based on a limitless government, bureaucratic arrogance and a disregard of a will of the people," said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind.
Another Republican, Rep. Darrell Issa of California, reacted angrily when asked whether he would eventually support a standalone spending bill if needed to prevent a shutdown. "How dare you presume a failure? How dare you? How dare you?" he said.

Iranians largely welcome president's US outreach, but pockets of anger signal challenges ahead
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Smiling and waving flags, Iranians from across the political spectrum welcomed President Hassan Rouhani home Saturday with cheers for his historic phone conversation with his American counterpart. But pockets of anger over the new contact between the two enemy nations signaled challenges ahead.
Hard-liners opposed to any improved contact with Washington made their objections clear as several dozen protesters chanting "Death to America" tried to block his motorcade in Tehran. The semiofficial Mehr news agency reported that at least one demonstrator hurled a shoe -- a common gesture of contempt in the Middle East -- in Rouhani's direction. Other reports said eggs were thrown at his car.
"Dialogue with Satan is not 'hope and prudence,'" some chanted, using the Rouhani's campaign from the June presidential election.
Rouhani supporters, meanwhile, greeted him with placards thanking him for seeking peace instead of confrontation. One banner read: "Yes to peace, no to war."
Friday's 15-minute phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama capped a week of drama revolving around Rouhani's participation in the annual U.N. meeting of world leaders.

Syria foreign minister: No transition peace plan without Assad; US-Iran warming no threat
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Syria's government will not accept any transition peace plan that excludes President Bashar Assad, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem told The Associated Press in an interview Saturday.
He spoke on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, a day after the Security Council approved a resolution that obliges Syria's government to comply with an international plan to destroy its chemical weapons arsenal. The resolution also endorsed the outcome of the Geneva conference between the government and the opposition in June 2012, which called for the establishment of a transitional government with full executive powers.
The Syrian opposition, which has been embroiled in a bloody conflict with Assad's forces for two and a half years, has repeatedly said it will not take part in any transition government that includes the president.
The latest statement from al-Moallem could mean that efforts to organize a second meeting of the opposition and the government later this year in Geneva may fail.
"For the Syrian people, Bashar Assad is the elected president until mid-2014, when presidential elections will be held," al-Moallem said. Other candidates are welcome to run under the country's constitution, he added, stressing that only the Syrian people can choose their president, not outside governments or the opposition, which is based abroad.

Italy's coalition government in crisis after Berlusconi ministers announce resignations
MILAN (AP) -- Italy's fragile coalition government was pushed into a full-fledged crisis Saturday after five ministers from former Premier Silvio Berlusconi's political party announced their resignations.
The move drew the ire of Premier Enrico Letta, who accused Berlusconi of a "crazy" gesture aimed at covering up his personal affairs.
The five-month-old government has teetered for weeks since the high court confirmed Berlusconi's tax fraud conviction.
Berlusconi's center-right People of Liberty Party is in an unusual coalition of rival forces with Letta's center-left Democratic Party, and the resignations signals the end of the alliance.
The resignations must be formally submitted to President Giorgio Napolitano, who must decide if there is any way to continue the government or if new elections must be held.

House OKs bill for improving safety of compounded drugs following 2012 meningitis deaths
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House easily approved bipartisan legislation Saturday aimed at improving the safety of drugs produced by compounding pharmacies that mix customized pharmaceuticals.
The measure, approved on a voice vote, comes almost a year after a meningitis outbreak that killed 64 people and sickened hundreds more was traced to a compounding company in Framingham, Mass. Inspectors later found unsanitary conditions at the New England Compounding Center, which has since closed.
The measure, aimed at improving how drugs are tracked from production until they are purchased at a drug store, would clarify what sponsors said was confusion over the Food and Drug Administration's authority over compounded drugs. It would also require the agency to coordinate its oversight of compounded-drug safety with states.
Compounders could voluntarily register as outsourcing facilities, which would bring them under FDA authority. Registering will let the agency identify who these companies are and what they produce, and allow the FDA to receive reports about any problems.
Companies that remain traditional pharmacies would continue to be overseen mostly by state pharmacy boards.

Investigation finds 30 minute radio blackout preceded deaths of 19 Arizona firefighters
PRESCOTT, Ariz. (AP) -- Shortly before 19 elite firefighters perished in a raging Arizona wildfire, commanders thought the crew was in a safe place. No one had heard from the Granite Mountain Hotshots for 33 minutes. The crew didn't contact commanders, and commanders didn't radio them.
Then it was too late.
A three-month investigation into the June 30 deaths released Saturday did not determine if the tragedy was avoidable, while outlining a series of missteps by the crew and commanders and revealing the more than half-hour of radio silence that occurred just before the firefighters were overwhelmed by flames.
It's not certain why the crew left what was believed to be a safe spot on a ridge that the fire had previously burned and, apparently seeking another safe location, unknowingly walked to their deaths in a basin thick with dry brush. At the time they died, an airtanker was circling overhead, confused about their location.
"There is much that cannot be known about the crew's decisions and actions" because of the gap in communications, the report concluded.

Greek authorities arrest leader, others from extreme right party in escalating crackdown
ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The leader of Greece's extreme-right Golden Dawn party and four other of its parliamentarians were formally charged Saturday with membership in a criminal organization with intent to commit crimes, in an escalation of a government crackdown after a fatal stabbing blamed on a supporter.
It was the first time since 1974 that sitting members of Parliament have been arrested. The arrests underline the Greek government's efforts to stifle the fiercely anti-immigrant party, which has been increasingly on the defensive since the killing.
Golden Dawn leader Nikos Michaloliakos, party spokesman Ilias Kassidiaris and Yannis Lagos, Nikos Michos and Ilias Panayiotaros were arrested by counterterrorism police. The last two gave themselves up voluntarily. A sixth parliamentarian, Christos Pappas -- described in a prosecutor's report as the Golden Dawn's No. 2 -- remains at large.
A further 15 people, including 13 Golden Dawn members and two police officers, have also been arrested and are due to appear before a prosecutor and an examining magistrate soon. They face the same charges.
Police spokesman Christos Pagonis told reporters that a total of arrest warrants were issued, all for the same charge; he added that the counterterrorism unit was still searching for the 12 suspects at large, including the missing deputy.

Call ends decades of silence between US, Iranian leaders; rift seems closer to being bridged
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was ending his visit to the United States and inching through New York's notorious traffic when the call came from President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
Fifteen minutes later, the two say goodbye in each other's language, and a generation-long rift between the U.S. and Iran was that much closer to being bridged.
Iranians awoke Saturday to learn about the groundbreaking conversation, the first in more than three decades between leaders of the two countries.
They pledged to resolve concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions, which have isolated Iranians from the rest of the world and led to crippling economic penalties.
Upon his arrival in Tehran on Saturday, Rouhani was met by both cheering supporters and opposition hardliners who tried to block his motorcade.

Syrian opposition should observe UN resolution: Lavrov

The UN Security Council resolution on chemical weapons in Syria will have to be observed not only by the Syrian authorities, but also by the opposition, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after The UN Security Council adopted a resolution on Friday that demands the eradication of Syria's chemical weapons.
 
The resolution, however does not threaten automatic punitive action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government if it does not comply, Reuters reported. 
 
‘The resolution does not fall under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and does not allow any automatic enforcement of coercive measures,” Lavrov said after the Security Council vote.
 
"The responsibility for the implementation of this resolution does not only lie on the government of Syria," he said.
 
The chemical weapons resolution on Syria establishes a framework for overcoming the ongoing political crisis. According to Lavrov, the Syrian opposition is also obliged to work with international experts as required by the Security Council resolution.
 
"We hope that more and more scattered groups of the  Syrian opposition will finally be able – as the Syrian government has already done for a long time – to declare its readiness to participate in an international conference without preconditions,” Lavrov said.
 
The unanimous vote by the 15-member Security Council capped weeks of intense diplomacy between Russia and the United States. It was based on a deal between the two countries reached in Geneva earlier this month following an August 21 sarin nerve gas attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds.
 
"Today's historic resolution is the first hopeful news on Syria in a long time," UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the council immediately after the vote. 
 
The Syrian sides must engage constructively in the upcoming Geneva 2 conference, which would be a significant step towards the “creation of a democratic state that guarantees the human rights of all in Syria,” Moon said in his address to the Council.   
 
“The regional actors have a responsibility to challenge those who will actively undermine the process and those who do not fully respect Syria’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity,” he added.
 
The target date for a new peace conference in Geneva was set for mid-November. However, the Syrian opposition should be represented at the Geneva peace talks in a single delegation, the Secretary-General said.
 
The adopted resolution calls for consequences if inspectors decide that Syria has failed to fulfill its obligations. The nature of the reaction, however, will depend on another resolution which would have to be passed in the event of non-compliance.

Syria given November deadline to destroy all chemical weapons facilities
Inspections to begin next week after UN votes unanimously to impose inspections on Syria under accelerated timetable

Syria will have to destroy all its chemical weapons production facilities by November and dismantle all its poison gases and nerve agents by the middle of next year, under an accelerated timetable drawn up by the world's chemical weapons watchdog.
The governing council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) agreed last night in The Hague for a disarmament plan starting on Tuesday when inspectors arrive in Syria to embark on the task of checking Syria's declared stockpile of chemical munitions, delivery systems and production facilities.
"This decision sends an unmistakable message that the international community is coming together to work for peace in Syria beginning with the elimination of chemical weapons in that country," said OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu.
The international agreement to secure Syria's chemical arsenal follows a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held suburbs in eastern Damascus on 21 August, and the subsequent threat of US military action.
The UN said yesterday that its weapons inspectors in Damascus were investigating a total of seven sites where chemical weapons were allegedly used, including three incidents after the 21 August attack. They were in Bahhariyeh and Jobar, both east of central Damascus, on 22 and 24 August, and Ashrafiat Sahnaya to the south-west of the capital on 25 August. The UN gave no further details.
The UN security council voted unanimously on Friday for a resolution that makes the OPCW legally binding on Bashar al-Assad 's regime. But under a compromise between Russia and the west clinched on Thursday, the resolution does not include automatic punitive measures against the Syrian government if it fails to comply.
Any punitive measures, from sanctions to military action, would require a second resolution. The OPCW plan, however, gives the inspectors a broad mandate. According to a draft published on the Trench website, run by Belgian chemical weapons expert Jean Pascal Zanders, Syria will have to give OPCW personnel "the immediate and unfettered right to inspect any and all sites in the Syrian Arab Republic".
The plan also sets a much faster pace for Syria compared with the requirements of the chemical weapons convention. The clock starts ticking for the government to meet its deadlines from the moment the OPCW council agrees the plan rather than the date on which Syria's membership of the convention formally starts, 14 October.
The plan states that Syria should "complete as soon as possible, and in any case not later than 1 November 2013, the destruction of chemical weapons production and mixing/filling equipment".
As the main production facilities lie in the heart of government-held territory, the destruction process is not expected to be held back by the continuing fighting. The OPCW plan then gives the Syrian government until the middle of 2014 to eliminate the rest of its arsenal. This deadline is far more challenging as the dismantling of munitions already loaded with chemical agents is a painstaking task.
The biggest question mark over the plan is what happens if Syria is caught cheating or dragging its heels. The west lost the battle to have the UN resolution implementing the plan under chapter seven of the UN charter, involving automatic punitive measures. Any such measures would require a further resolution.
But a senior US administration ­official argued that the wording of the draft ­resolution due to be voted on was tough, and implied serious consequences for noncompliance. "I think you'll see in the final language that, in fact, for the first time, we have said that the use of chemical weapons is a threat to international peace and security," the official said.
After the security council vote, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, said: "Security council shows diplomacy can be so powerful, it can defuse the worst weapons. If this resolution is implemented, we will have eliminated one of the biggest chemical weapons arsenals on earth, in one of the most volatile regions on earth."
The UN secretary general said that the resolution banning Syria's chemical weapons could not become "a licence to kill with conventional weapons".  He called for a new Syria peace conference in mid-November.

UN resolution shifts focus to Syrian peace process

Syria unrest
NEW YORK // The hard-won United Nations resolution that forces Syria to give up its chemical weapons has led to a renewed focus on peace negotiations, with the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon setting a target date of mid-November.
But the western- and Arab League-backed Syrian opposition group that would take part in the so-called Geneva II negotiations is weaker now than perhaps at any time since it was formed, and experts doubt that the talks, if they do take place, will result in a deal.
On Friday night, after days of US-Russian negotiations, the UN Security Council unanimously passed resolution 2118, which orders Syria to give up its chemical weapons stockpiles for destruction by mid-2014.
The resolution, which includes a faster-than-expected timetable, does not contain a trigger for the use of force or sanctions if Syria does not comply. If Syria is found to have violated the terms of the plan, the Security Council will meet again to pass a second resolution laying out consequences.
The Syrian National Coalition leader Ahmad Jarba officially backed the resolution on Friday, but it does not include items the SNC was pushing for, such as the threat of force or addressing Syria’s use of conventional weapons against its citizens, such as missiles and fighter jets.
Other members of the group expressed bitterness.
“The … resolution is a big disappointment for us,” said SNC member Samir Nashar. “It serves the interests of most regional and international powers, including the Syrian regime ... but by no stretch of the imagination does it serve the Syrian people or the Syrian revolution.”
Many inside Syria had long questioned the SNC’s legitimacy, claiming its leadership, based in Istanbul is not representative and disconnected from those living in the war zone. The group suffered the greatest blow to its leadership on Tuesday, when 11 of the most formidable rebel groups, including its strongest militias, denounced dissociated themselves from the SNC.
The terms of the UN resolution also weakened the SNC’s bargaining position by showing they effectively had no input into a deal worked out between the US and Russia, both of whom were focused on the limited goal of preventing US military involvement in the conflict by addressing the chemical weapons.
The leaders of the SNC represent an old opposition elite, western-educated, moderate and committed to a pluralistic future Syria, said Joshua Landis, a Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma. But a new opposition elite has emerged in Syria, comprised of the leaders of the largest militias, and they see the SNC as ineffective in its dealings with western powers.
Even though the US is unlikely to abandon the SNC before any Geneva talks, the group will be unlikely to deliver. “The US is in a very weak position in Geneva II,” Mr Landis said. “All the Russians have to do is deliver Assad to the table, and he said he’s willing, but the Americans have to get the SNC to represent all of Syria’s rebels, which is an [impossible] task.
“They have to talk to the people who actually have guns, otherwise getting a ceasefire is unrealistic. But getting [the many rebel groups] to agree on anything is impossible, so of course the whole thing is impossible.”
The SNC maintains its demand that Bashar Al Assad resigns before a peace deal is made, something the US is unable to guarantee without the direct use of military force, which Washington has refused to consider.
The unexpected thaw in US-Iran relations also comes at a key moment in efforts to bring about peace negotiations in Syria. Iran’s charm offensive over the past two weeks, which culminated in a historic phone call between US President Barack Obama and his newly elected Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, is intended to accelerate an end to crushing sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme.
But, Mr Landis said, the Iranian initiative is also spurred by Tehran’s realisation that its major allies in the Middle East – Damascus, Baghdad and Hizbollah – are all being rapidly weakened by the Syrian war. Offering Mr Obama a nuclear deal – a central goal of US Middle East policy, “takes the pressure off of Iran’s allies”, Mr Landis said.
“Why would he want to jeopardise a nuke deal with Iran by sending a bunch of arms to people who stood with Al Qaeda two days ago? It doesn’t make any sense.”
And without doing more to strengthen the rebel fighters, their ties with the US-backed SNC will fray further and render any Geneva deal weak and unenforceable.
“Obama has decided he can accomplish two things: uphold the 100-year-old international ban on chemical weapons, and try get a nuclear deal with Iran,” Mr Landis said. “Affecting a transition of power from Assad to an opposition group that is peaceful, secular, pro-America? It seems impossible today.”

Syria says it will facilitate UN work to secure and destroy country's chemical weapons
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  
September 28, 2013 - 3:25 pm EDT
BEIRUT — Syria's prime minister says Damascus will fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors charged with destroying the country's chemical weapons stockpile.
Wael al-Halqi's comments Saturday come a day after the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to purge Syria of its chemical weapons program.
Al-Halqi said in an interview with Lebanon's Al Manar TV that Syria "welcomed the resolution" and "will fulfill its international duties." He also said the government "will facilitate the work of the inspectors."
The U.N. resolution passed on Friday allows the start of a mission to rid Syria's regime of its estimated 1,000-ton chemical arsenal by mid-2014. It also calls for consequences if Syria fails to comply, but those will depend on the council passing another resolution in the event of non-compliance.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.
Syrian rebels including members of an al-Qaida-linked group captured Saturday a military post on the border with Jordan after four days of fighting, an activist group said.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 26 soldiers were killed in the battle as well as a number of rebels, including seven foreign fighters. The post served in the past as the customs office on the border with Jordan. It was turned into an army post years ago.
The post is on the outskirts of the southern city of Daraa where the uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime began in March 2011. The uprising later turned into a civil war that killed more than 100,000 people, according to the U.N.

Rebels control multiple areas along the borders with Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Lebanon as well as the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
Also Saturday some U.N. inspectors left their hotel in Damascus in one vehicle to an unknown location, according to an Associated Press photographer at the scene.
The U.N. said Friday its team of weapons experts currently in Syria will investigate seven sites of alleged chemical attacks in the country, four more than previously known. The announcement came hours before the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile.
The team initially visited Syria last month to investigate three alleged chemical attacks this year. But just days into the visit, the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Ghouta was hit by a chemical strike, and the inspectors turned their attention to that case. The inquiry determined that the nerve agent sarin was used in the Aug. 21 attack, but it did not assess who was behind it.
The U.S. says more than 1,400 people were killed in the attack while activists gave a smaller number but still in the hundreds.
The UN team of investigators expects to finalize its activities in the country by Monday, a U.N. statement said.
On Thursday, the world's chemical weapons watchdog adopted a U.S.-Russian plan that lays out benchmarks and timelines for cataloguing, quarantining and ultimately destroying Syria's chemical weapons, their precursors and delivery systems.
The Security Council resolution enshrines the plan approved by Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, making it legally binding.
The agreement allows the start of a mission to rid Syria's regime of its estimated 1,000-ton chemical arsenal by mid-2014, significantly accelerating a destruction timetable that often takes years to complete.
A draft of the OPCW decision obtained by The Associated Press calls for the first inspectors to be in Syria by Tuesday.

President Obama praises proposed chemical weapons deal with Syria
Russia helped negotiate a United Nations plan
Obama spoke after meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
SHARE 114 CONNECT 28 TWEET 39 COMMENTEMAILMORE
President Obama hailed a proposed chemical weapons agreement with Syria on Friday, calling it a "'potentially huge victory for the international community."
Under a deal reached Thursday, a proposed United Nations resolution would require Syria to give up its chemical weapons stockpiles and allow inspectors access to all sites.
The proposal does not call for force, which would require a second resolution if Syria fails to comply.
Obama, speaking after a meeting with India Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, said there are still questions about Syria's follow-through, as well as the technical details of removing chemical weapons in the midst of Syria's civil war.
"Obviously, there's a lot of work to be done," he said.
In late August, Obama discussed the possibility of military action against Syria over an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack on anti-government rebels. Obama later said he would seek U.S. congressional approval for a military strike.
As lawmakers and other nations opposed the idea of military action, Obama agreed to a proposal by Russia -- an ally of Syria -- to negotiate the removal of chemical weapons.
Obama said, "it's doubtful that we would have arrived at this point had it not been for a credible threat of U.S. action," but he added: "I've always expressed a preference for resolving this diplomatically."

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The inspectors responsible for tracking down Syria's chemical arms stockpile and verifying its destruction plan to start work in Syria by Tuesday. They will face their tightest deadlines ever and work right in the heart of a war zone, according to a draft decision obtained Friday by The Associated Press.
The decision is the key to any U.N. resolution on Syria's chemical weapons program.
The five permanent members of the deeply divided U.N. Security Council reached agreement Thursday on a resolution to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons. A vote depends on how soon the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is to meet Friday evening at its headquarters in The Hague, can adopt its plan for securing and destroying Syria's stockpile.
The draft agreed upon by Russia, China, the United States, France and Britain includes two legally binding demands — that Syria abandons its chemical stockpile and allows unfettered access to the chemical weapons experts.
If Syria fails to comply, the draft says the Security Council would need to adopt a second resolution to impose possible military and other actions on Damascus.
Nonetheless, after 2 ½ years of paralysis, the agreement represents a breakthrough for the Security Council and rare unity between Russia, which supports Syrian President Bashar Assad's government, and the United States, which backs the opposition.
The proposal to be discussed Friday by the OPCW would allow inspectors into any site suspected of chemical weapons involvement even if Syria's government did not identify the location. That gives the inspectors unusually broad authority.
The draft calls for the organization's secretariat to start inspections "as soon as possible and no later than" Tuesday and it lays out the target of destroying all of Syria's chemical weapons and equipment by the first half of 2014.
In an indication of the enormity of the task ahead, the organization also appealed for donations to fund the disarmament, saying it will have to hire new weapons inspectors and chemical experts.
Once the plan is approved, it gives Damascus a week to give detailed information on its arsenal, including the name and quantity of all chemicals in its stockpile; the type of and quantity of munitions that can be used to fire chemical weapons and the location of weapons, storage facilities and production facilities. The destruction of all chemical weapons production and mixing equipment has to be completed no later than Nov. 1.
The decision calls on Syria to "cooperate fully with all aspects of the implementation of this decision" and let the inspectors examine any location they choose.
The diplomatic push to find some agreement on Syria was triggered by an Aug. 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb and President Barack Obama's subsequent threat to use military force.
When U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Assad could avert U.S. military action by turning over "every single bit of his chemical weapons" to international control within a week, Russia quickly agreed.
Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signed an agreement in Geneva on Sept. 13 to put Syria's chemical weapons under international control for later destruction. Assad's government accepted the deal and quickly signed up to Chemical Weapons Convention that is policed by the Hague-based OPCW.
Meanwhile, a group of international war crimes experts is calling for the creation of a war crimes court in Damascus to try top-ranking Syrian politicians and soldiers when the country's civil war ends.
The war that began in March 2011 has so far claimed more than 100,000 lives in Syria and forced hundreds of thousands to flee the violence, according to the U.N.

“One of the problems down the road is going to get a sufficient confidence level that even if you know where the declared inventories are, and you are working your way through, locking down or eliminating those inventories, there will be a nagging suspicion that there may be hidden stockpiles elsewhere," Thielmann said.
He points to an earlier experience. “This happened in Libya, by the way. We thought that we were working well with Gadhafi and in fact had eliminated most of the chemical weapons arsenal that he had. But then after he was overthrown, we ran into additional storage areas of mustard agent we didn’t even know about.”
Confidence is key
Charles Duelfer headed the Iraq Survey Group investigating the extent of Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. He says inspectors in Syria will have to make split-second decisions.
“For example: if a weapons inspector says 'I want to go into this facility' to see if there is prohibited materiel there. He may say he needs to be there within five minutes. Well if there is some delay, that weapons inspector has to be able to judge whether this is a delay that is due to natural causes - some guy didn’t show up, or whatever - or is it with malice aforethought. And he should report that to the U.N. Security Council," Duelfer said. "These are the day to day decisions which weapons inspectors and their counterparts, in this case Syria, have to work through. And nobody can do that from New York or any capital - it has to be done on the ground.”
Duelfer said Iraq’s chemical weapons arsenal was destroyed within the country and the same could be done in Syria.
Date too optimistic
But Greg Thielmann, with the Arms Control Association, sees another scenario.
“Another thing I think we will have to worry about is if indeed it is decided that the best way to get the chemical weapons out of Syria is to move them to a Syrian port and shipment to Russia that has already existing capabilities to destroy chemical weapons -- moving anything in Syria in the midst of a civil war is going to be difficult. So keeping the agent under control and protecting the people who are assigned to that task will be further complications,” Thielmann said.
Given the potential problems, many analysts say the U.S.-Russia accord's deadline of mid 2014 for destroying all of Syria’s chemical weapons - whether in country or elsewhere - is too optimistic.

September 27, 2013
International experts will begin inspecting Syria's chemical arsenal by Tuesday under a plan set to be approved by the world's top chemical weapons monitoring group.
 
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will vote late Friday on the draft resolution, which calls for inspections within 30 days at all chemical weapons sites declared by Syria's government.
 
The draft also requires Syria to provide OPCW inspectors access to "any other site identified by a State Party as having been involved" in Syria's chemical weapons program.
 
If approved, the demands will become part of a U.N. Security Council draft resolution that will formalize a plan requiring President Bashar al-Assad to give up his chemical weapons by mid-2014.
 
In violence Friday, activists said a car bomb killed at least 30 people and wounded dozens in the town of Rankus, just north of Damascus.
 
Rankus is a Sunni town in a region mostly under control of rebels trying to overthrow Assad's government.
 
The United States and Russia agreed Thursday on the language of the Security Council draft resolution, following weeks of negotiations about how to ensure Assad complies with the disarmament plan.
 
U.S. officials praised the text as legally binding and enforceable, though it does not include an automatic trigger for enforcement if Syria does not comply, as the White House had wanted.
 
President Assad agreed earlier this month to give up his chemical weapons, following threats of U.S. military strikes in response to a poison gas attack on a rebel-held area last month that killed hundreds.
 
Assad denies carrying out the attack. He and his Russian allies say rebels trying to overthrow his government were behind the incident. 
 
The conflict in Syria has killed more than 100,000 people.

Britain wages war on Internet porn
Anthony Faiola
The government is in the midst of adopting some of the strictest curbs on pornography in the Western world.
Among the questions that remain are whether the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has fully declared its stockpile; whether the inspectors will be secure in dangerous territory where control is fluid; and whether the team can meet ambitious timetables, approved Saturday, under which it must destroy Syria’s capability to produce chemical weapons by Nov. 1 and eliminate all chemical and munitions stockpiles by July 1. Such efforts usually take years.
Critics say that the agency’s consensus-driven approach to resolving conflicts about disclosures may move too slowly for a fast-moving situation and that it has little experience doing detective work when weapons are hidden.
But officials at the 16-year-old agency, housed in a building in The Hague that looks like a round of Edam cheese missing a wedge, say they are up for the challenge.
“People are still getting their heads around being in the global limelight,” said Michael Luhan, the OPCW’s sole spokesman, who juggled three phones for hours on a recent day as hundreds of journalists called to ask for details about Syria’s surprise enumeration of its chemical weaponry. “If this is not an example of building a plane and flying it at the same time, I don’t know what is.”
Not a 24-7 organization
The OPCW is tasked with implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention , which took effect in 1997 and requires the elimination of all chemical weapons by the 189 states — 190 including Syria — that are party to the agreement. That work has taken inspectors to unstable countries such as Libya and Iraq.
Most of the efforts, however, have been devoted to overseeing the slow, methodical destruction of vast stores of American and Russian weaponry, along with inspecting chemical plants around the world to ensure that they are not being used to produce new weapons. Improvising under live fire typically has not been the agency’s task. Most plans are made a year in advance.
“It’s kind of a 9-to-5 organization, in a way. It’s not a 24-7 organization, and it’s going to have to adapt to that,” said Faiza Patel, a former senior policy officer at the OPCW. “The organization is not really set up to be an investigative organization,” unlike the U.N. investigators who were sent to Iraq in the 1990s, she said. “It’s set up to do routine inspections that are based on the declarations that the states provide.”

The attack appeared to hit the yard in front of the school early Sunday morning, which is the first day of the work week at public schools in Syria.
Observatory director Rami Abdul-Rahman said at least eight of the dead were students, and that the death toll is likely to rise because many of the wounded are in critical condition.
Amateur videos posted online showed at least nine bodies, some of them missing limbs, lying on pockmarked-pavement strewn with rubble. At least four of the bodies appeared to be of young people. Another video shows pools of blood on the ground and a concrete-block wall destroyed in the bombing.
The videos appeared genuine and corresponded to other AP reporting of the events depicted.

The government is in the midst of adopting some of the strictest curbs on pornography in the Western world.
The intensifying power struggle between disparate factions fighting to topple President Bashar Assad is threatening to further encumber a rebellion plagued by divisions and outgunned by the regime.
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, an al-Qaida offshoot consisting mostly of foreign fighters, has sought to expand its influence in opposition held territories, employing brutal tactics and trying to impose Islamic law.
That has created a backlash against the group from more moderate factions concerned that extremists are discrediting their rebellion.
Highlighting the militants’ growing muscle, activists said members of the ISIL broke the crosses off two churches and burned the contents of another in the northeastern city of Raqqa, hoisting in their place their group’s black Islamic banner.
The action triggered a protest by residents of Raqqa, which fell into rebel hands last year and has since been controlled mostly by extremist factions, according to a resident of the city who identified himself only by his first name, Amir, for fear of reprisals.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed the incident.
The ISIL commander was killed in clashes with Kurdish militiamen in Aleppo province, activists said. Fighting between the two sides in predominantly Kurdish regions of the north has gone on for months, killing hundreds of people on both sides.
The man, identified by the Observatory as a UAE national and the emir — or local commander — of Aleppo, died Wednesday night.
On Monday, a top al-Qaida commander was killed in an ambush by rival Western-backed rebels from the Free Syrian Army rebel umbrella group.
Still, several groups operating under the FSA are increasingly aligning themselves with more radical groups.
Nearly a dozen of Syria’s powerful rebel factions formally broke with the main opposition group in exile and called for Islamic law in the country Wednesday, dealing a severe blow to the Western-backed coalition.
The radicalization may complicate the mission of U.N. experts who were back in Syria this week to investigate three alleged incidents of chemical weapons use earlier this year, including two in the north.
The inspectors were seen leaving their Damascus hotel in a vehicle convoy on Thursday afternoon, but there was no indication where they went.
Russia, meanwhile, offered Thursday to provide troops to guard facilities where Syria’s chemical weapons would be destroyed.
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow is ready to ensure security and help guard facilities, once the chemical weapons are stored for destruction in Syria.
He emphasized that Moscow will not accept the Syrian chemical weapons to be dismantled in Russian territory.

The resolution, already agreed on by the five veto-wielding members, was expected to pass easily late Friday at the United Nations, breaking a nearly three-year deadlock on the council, which had been deeply divided on Syria.
“The good news is there’s a decision and we expect to have an advance team on the ground (in Syria) next week,” OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan told reporters at the organization’s Hague headquarters.
The risks inspectors will face were underscored when a car bomb exploded outside a mosque north of Damascus, killing at least 30 people, the latest victims of a civil war which has claimed more than 100,000 lives and driven another 7 million — around a third of the country’s pre-war population — from their homes since March 2011.
Law experts, meanwhile, said discussions were underway to set up a war crimes tribunal for Syria to punish perpetrators from all sides of atrocities.
The agreement in The Hague allows the start of a mission to rid Syria’s regime of its estimated 1,000-ton chemical arsenal by mid-2014, significantly accelerating a destruction timetable that often takes years to complete.
“This decision sends an unmistakable message that the international community is coming together to work for peace in Syria beginning with the elimination of chemical weapons in that country,” OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said in a statement.
The draft Security Council resolution agreed upon Thursday by Russia, China, the United States, France and Britain includes two legally binding demands — that Syria abandon its chemical stockpile and allow unfettered access to the chemical-weapons experts.
If Syria fails to comply, the draft says, the Security Council would need to adopt a second resolution to impose possible military and other actions on Damascus under Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter.
President Barack Obama called the Security Council deal “potentially a huge victory for the international community.”
The agreement shaping up for approval Friday represents a breakthrough after 2½ years of paralysis in the Security Council.
Diplomatic efforts to find some agreement on Syria gathered momentum in the aftermath of an Aug. 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb and Obama’s subsequent threat to use military force.
The U.S. and Russia agree that Syria has roughly 1,000 metric tons of chemical weapons agents and precursors, including blister agents such as sulfur and mustard gas and nerve agents like sarin.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the U.N. on Friday that progress in Syrian chemical disarmament “should give an impetus to” moves to establish a zone “free of weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery in the Middle East.”

Britain wages war on Internet porn

The government is in the midst of adopting some of the strictest curbs on pornography in the Western world.
Britain’s U.N. ambassador, Mark Lyall Grant, tweeted that Britain, France, the U.S., Russia and China had agreed on a “binding and enforceable draft ... resolution.”
He said Britain will introduce the text to the 10 other members of the Security Council at a meeting Thursday night.
The U.S. and Russia had been at odds on how to enforce the resolution, but Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power confirmed that the last hurdles to agreement had been overcome.
On Twitter, Power said the draft resolution establishes that Syria’s chemical weapons “is threat to international peace & security & creates a new norm against the use of CW.”
U.N. diplomats said it would be the first legally binding resolution on Syria in the conflict if adopted, which now appears virtually certain.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in hastily scheduled, closed-door talks Thursday afternoon at the United Nations, and the agreement was announced soon afterward.
The agreement came a day after Russia’s deputy foreign minister said negotiators had overcome a major hurdle and agreed that the resolution would include a reference to Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows for military and nonmilitary actions to promote peace and security.
In Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov offered to provide troops to guard facilities where Syria’s chemical weapons would be destroyed.
The P-5 have been discussing for weeks what to include in a new resolution requiring that Syria’s chemical weapons be secured and dismantled. The U.S. and Russia had been at odds on how to enforce the resolution.
The flurry of diplomatic activity is in response to an Aug. 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb, and President Barack Obama’s threat of U.S. strikes in retaliation.
After Kerry said Syrian President Bashar Assad could avert U.S. military action by turning over “every single bit of his chemical weapons” to international control within a week, Russia, Syria’s most important ally, agreed. Kerry and Lavrov signed an agreement in Geneva on Sept. 13.
Assad’s government quickly accepted the broad proposal, but there have been tough negotiations on how its stockpile will be destroyed.

Before Syria vote at U.N., tense talks for Kerry and Russian counterpart
PETER FOLEY/EPA - Secretary of State John F. Kerry.
By Anne Gearan, E-mail the writer
UNITED NATIONS — Despite a week of daily negotiations between the United States and Russia over the planned destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons, the two sides were still deeply split on a fundamental point when Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met last Tuesday.
The scheduled 45-minute session Tuesday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly took place in a tiny Russian meeting room at the United Nations, with an enormous portrait of President Vladimir Putin on the wall. It ran for about 90 minutes, with Kerry and Lavrov, flanked by their U.N. ambassadors and other aides, making pencil edits to a four-page draft that represents a major departure in each country’s approach to the Syrian civil war.
Russia wanted more lax ways to make sure that ally and arms client Syria complied with the agreement to give up its toxic stores; the United States wanted a toughly-worded U.N. Security Council resolution that spelled out what Syria had to do and the consequences Damascus would face for reneging.
The resolution approved unanimously by the 15-member Security Council three days later split the difference, but not before some drama that included a tense, 11 p.m. telephone call between Kerry and Lavrov.
“That was a tough conversation,” a senior State Department official said Saturday, with Kerry suggesting that their mutual goal of getting the agreement completed during the General Assembly was in peril. Several U.S. officials and other diplomats spoke on the condition of anonymity provided a look at the makings of the deal, because much of the discussion with Russian officials was confidential.
The Russian position leading up to the General Assembly meeting had stressed a lesser role for the Security Council, which the U.S. side saw as a way to water down a historic agreement to rid Syria of toxic weapons. Russia preferred to leave most responsibility for reporting on Syrian progress or the lack of it to the U.N.-affiliated Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which has no real enforcement power.
“Their approach initially was, ‘Syria voluntarily does this,’ and our whole frame was, ‘Are you kidding? This regime just gassed more than 400 children,’â€Š” Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Saturday.
The United States and Russia, which back opposing sides in the conflict, had reached an agreement in principle earlier this month in Geneva to put Syria’s chemical weapons stores under international control. That agreement averted imminent U.S. cruise missile strikes on Syria in protest over the poison gas massacre of more than 1,000 people on Aug. 21. Syria agreed to give up its weapons under heavy pressure from Russia.
A Security Council vote endorsing the program would be the first firm action at the world body since the Syrian war began. All previous attempts to punish or condemn Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were blocked by Russia, which, like the United States, holds a veto.

U.S. and Russian officials now believe that the vast majority of Syria’s nerve agent stockpile consists of “unweaponized” liquid precursors that could be neutralized relatively quickly, lowering the risk that the toxins could be hidden away by the regime or stolen by terrorists.
A confidential assessment by the United States and Russia also concludes that Syria’s entire arsenal could be destroyed in about nine months, assuming that Syrian officials honor promises to cede control of the chemical assets to international inspectors, according to two people briefed on the analysis.

The U.S. and Russia agreed on the wording of a U.N. resolution. If the plan is approved, U.N. inspections would begin by Tuesday.
The assessment, thought to be the most authoritative to date, reflects the consensus view of Russian and U.S. analysts who compared their governments’ intelligence on Syria during meetings in Geneva this month . The Obama administration has since briefed independent experts on the key findings.
The insights into Syria’s arsenal have been bolstered further by the Damascus government’s own accounting, which lists the types of chemical agents and delivery systems it possesses, and was presented Saturday to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague . U.S. officials have reviewed the Syrian inventory, which has not been publicly released, and “found it quite good,” a senior State Department official told reporters.
The White House declined to comment on the assessments, which have been kept under wraps amid intense negotiations at the United Nations on a plan for dismantling Syria’s chemical stockpile. The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council agreed Thursday on a resolution that requires Syria to surrender its chemical weapons.
Russia has long been a close ally and arms supplier to Syria and maintains strong ties to its military and intelligence services. Obama administration officials have said that Russian and U.S. intelligence agencies had independently reached similar conclusions about the size of Syria’s chemical weapons program, regarded as one of the world’s largest.
Findings spur optimism
In private briefings to weapons experts, White House officials said analysts had concluded that Syria possesses more than 1,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, of which about 300 metric tons are sulfur mustard, the blister agent used in World War I. Nearly all of the remainder consists of chemical precursors of nerve agents, described as being “unweaponized” and in “liquid bulk” form, according to two people who attended the White House briefings.
In military weapons programs, two chemical precursors for the nerve agent sarin are blended using special equipment as the toxins are loaded into rockets, bombs or artillery shells.
Weapons experts not privy to the briefings described the findings as encouraging. Several noted that it is far easier to destroy precursor chemicals than battlefield-­ready liquid sarin or warheads already loaded with the toxin.
“If the vast majority of it consists of precursors in bulk form, that is very good news,” said Michael Kuhlman, chief scientist in the national security division at Battelle , a company that has supervised the destruction of much of the United States’ Cold War-era chemical stockpile. “Now you’re dealing with tanks of chemicals that are corrosive and dangerous, but not nerve agents. And the destruction processes for those chemicals are well in hand.”

U.N. Security Council unanimously passes Syria chemical weapons resolution

UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously late Friday to approve an ambitious plan requiring Syria to surrender its chemical weapons for destruction, the first major diplomatic milestone reached more than two years after the start of the Syrian conflict.
The resolution, adopted by a vote of 15 to 0, does not spell out what penalties the government in Damascus might face if it doesn’t comply. U.S. and European diplomats conceded that some of their toughest wording aimed at compelling Syria to obey the council’s demands and holding perpetrators to account for using chemical weapons was removed from the final resolution at Russia’s insistence.
Still, the measure constituted the first legally binding action on Syria from the Security Council since the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched a brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters in early 2011.
The conflict has descended into a brutal civil war, leaving more than 100,000 dead and threatening to engulf the region in sectarian conflict. Russia had previously blocked all attempts to punish or condemn Assad at the Security Council, which can order mandatory sanctions or military action.
“This is the first hopeful news on Syria for a long time. Tonight, the international community has delivered,” U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said. He urged the council’s big powers to follow up by convening a long-awaited ­Syrian peace conference in Geneva by the middle of November.
The agreement binds Syria to turn over its chemical arsenal but provides no automatic punishment if Syria balks. Enforcement would require further negotiation, setting up the prospect of more tussles between the United States and Russia .
The White House claimed victory, citing the prospect of weapons inspectors entering Syria as soon as next week to begin the work of auditing and dismantling the country’s chemical stockpile. “This is something that we have long sought,” President Obama said at the White House on Friday. The deal worked out this week on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly will be “legally binding” and enforceable, Obama said, with “consequences for Syria’s failure to meet what has been set forth in this resolution.”
But the council action received a cool response from the Syrian opposition. “We don’t believe the removal of chemical weapons will end the suffering of the Syrian people. Therefore, we have emphasized the need to do more to end the war and particularly to stop the regime from using heavy weapons against population centers — particularly ballistic missiles and jets,” Ahmad al-Jarba, president of the Syrian Opposition Coalition, told reporters in New York.
Secretary of State John F. Kerry hailed the council action as a show of unity that promises the elimination of one of the world’s largest chemical weapons stockpiles, one that had remained secret for decades. The United States and its allies say the arsenal was used in an Aug. 21 attack that killed about 1,400 Syrians, including more than 400 children, many as they slept.

“We did reach agreement with respect to the resolution; we’re now doing final work putting that language together,” Kerry said after the meeting. He expressed hope that “this resolution can now give life hopefully to the removal and destruction of chemical weapons in Syria.”
“I think we reached an understanding with the U.S.,” Lavrov told reporters Thursday night at the United Nations.
The diplomatic moves over Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal came after an Aug. 21 attack near Damascus that a U.N. report found included the use of the nerve agent sarin. The United States says that more than 1,400 civilians, including at least 426 children, died in the strike, which brought Washington to the brink of military intervention before  an accord was struck between the United States and Russia.
The draft U.N. resolution based on that accord says that if the Syrian government or the rebels fail to comply with their obligations to rid the country of chemical weapons, the Security Council “will impose measures under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter,” which is generally invoked to impose sanctions or approve the use of force. But considering such measures would require the passage of an additional resolution in the Security Council, where Russia is expected to block any proposal for the use of force and resist the imposition of stiff sanctions.
After Thursday’s meeting, a senior administration official said the agreed-on text would be shared later that night with all 15 Security Council members. French and Russian officials said a vote on the resolution was likely Friday evening. Lavrov extended his stay so that he could vote Friday.
The State Department official portrayed the agreement as a “historic and unprecedented” achievement, saying it would place Syria’s chemical weapons under international control for the first time and would mark the first time that the Security Council had declared the use of chemical weapons a threat to international peace and security.
“This is a breakthrough arrived at through hard-fought diplomacy,” the official said. “Equally as important, it makes absolutely clear that failure of the Assad regime to comply will have consequences.”
The resolution, which “strongly condemns” the use of chemical weapons in Syria’s civil war, will establish an international inspection team managed jointly by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. It requires that Syrian authorities and rebels grant the inspectors immediate and unfettered access to sites and individuals linked to the Syrian program.
Although the draft resolution expresses a “strong conviction that individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic should be held accountable,” there is no mechanism for prosecuting them. An earlier version of the draft would have authorized prosecution by the International Criminal Court, but it was scrubbed at the insistence of Russia.

The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously on Friday night to secure and destroy Syria’s chemical weapons — putting the   weight of previously divided world powers behind the recent deal between   the U.S. and Russia to pressure Syrian President Bashar Assad into   giving up his chemical stockpile.
While the resolution falls short  of carrying a specific military threat  against Mr. Assad if he does not  comply with weapons inspectors going  forward, world leaders hailed the  development as a major breakthrough in  the paralysis that has gripped  the Security Council since the war  between Syrian military forces and  opposition rebel fighters began in  Syria more than two years ago.
SEE ALSO: Syria vows to abide by U.N. resolution
Previously,  Russia and China previously vetoed three Western-backed  resolutions  that had sought to pressure Mr. Assad’s government to stop  using  military force against its own citizens. But both nations backed  the  new resolution, which Russia hailed as a major success on Friday night.
Separately,  the resolution also endorses a broadly-framed roadmap  for a potential  political transition in Syria. While the past year saw  negotiations  among world powers stalled on the issue, U.N. Secretary  General Ban  Ki-moon said Friday night that mid-November would be a tentative date for new Syria-focused peace conference to be held in Geneva.
Partial victory for U.S.
The  Securitiy Council  resolution calls for consequences if Syria fails to  comply on the  chemical weapons front — but the language agreed to  member nations  remained somewhat vague about precisely what such  consequences could  entail.
If U.N. weapons inspectors conclude  that Mr. Assad is suddenly not  complying, they can trigger new action  on the Security Council, which  would then debate the passage of  separate, future resolution that could  approve a military strike  against Syria.
Since the window would then be open for Russia to veto such a resolution, most foreign policy insiders read Friday night’s development as only a partial victory for the Obama administration.
At   issue is that fact that administration lost the fight for a Security   Council resolution that would carry with it the specific threat of an   international military action against Syria in the event that Mr. Assad   is seen to be attempting to hoodwink U.N. weapons inspectors during the   weeks and months ahead.
In order to get Russia to agree to the  passage of any Security  Council action this week, the Obama  administration was forced to settle  for what ultimately amounted to a  softer resolution.
The  development also signaled a significant  back-step by the White House,  which less than a month ago had  threatened the possibility of a  unilateral U.S. military strike against  Syria as retribution for an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack that occurred near the Syrian capitol of   Damascus — and which U.S. intelligence community says was carried out   by forces loyal to Mr. Assad.
The concession aside, the Obama administration hailed Friday night’s Security Council resolution as a tremendous diplomatic triumph,   since it means the wider international community is now putting its   weight behind a major public push to rid Syria and Mr. Assad of chemical   weapons.
“Five weeks ago, the world saw rows upon rows of  murdered children  lying on a hospital floor alone or beside slain  parents, all wrapped in un-bloodied burial shrouds. And the world’s  conscience was shocked, but  our collective resolved hardened,” Secretary of State John F. Kerry said  after the resolution had passed.
“Tonight,  with a strong, enforceable, precedent-setting resolution  requiring  Syria to give up its chemical weapons, the United Nations  Security  Council has demonstrated that diplomacy can be so powerful, it  can  peacefully defuse the worst weapons of war,” Mr. Kerry said.
Heading into the vote, President Obama described the resolution as “a potentially huge victory for the international community.”
